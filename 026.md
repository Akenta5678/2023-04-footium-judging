# FootiumAcademy's maxGenerationId variable could be set to any number.

## Summary
maxGenerationId can be set to any number with out validation and could create conflict in mintPlayers() function.
Example, if the _maxGenerationId is set to 0 and mintPlayers() has an array of generationIds with elements greater than 0, the function will fail.

There is no validation logic implemented in changeMaxGenerationId() to make sure mintPlayer function will continue to work.
Ofcourse, this function is available only to owner and that is the only line of defence since he is the one managing the FootiumAcademy.


## Vulnerability Detail
mintPlayer function will not work as expected if the  generationId is set incorrectly to a lower number, say 0 and while minting, generationIds arrays has more the 1 element.

## Impact
Minting players may not work as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Define the business rules and make the impementation explicitly clear on how the generations should be managed.
Add validation to ensure the updating function meets the validation criteria before updating the storage variables.
