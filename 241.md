# Return value of `transfer` function is not checked which leads to false claim and lost prize

## Summary
Return value of `transfer` function is not checked which leads to false claim

## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol`, in Line 130, 

`            _token.transfer(_to, value);`
The address of _token is user controllable. So if user thinks that he wants to claim prize in ZRX token, and he passes the address of ZRX token to the function `claimERC20Prize`, then in Line 130, the problem occurs. 
The `_token.transfer(_to, value)` function will return `false`, because the contract doesn't have enough ZRX tokens and will return `false`.
But as the return value is not checked, the contract will not be aware of this failure. 
Hence contract will think that the ZRX tokens are transferred, it will increase the `totalERC20Claimed` value, and will `emit` to let the frontend know, but in reality the transfer failed. 

Furthermore, user will not be able to reclaim the prize , by providing a valid token address like Footium token address, as the record is already updated, and also because of this line 

`uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];`

## Impact
User will not be able to claim ERC20 prize, if ZRX tokens are used. And even if in the first time user has used the ZRX token accidentally, he will not be able to reclaim his prize by providing a valid token address (Footium address) next time.
