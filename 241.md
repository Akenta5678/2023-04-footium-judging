# Unchecked return value leads to incorrect `ERC20Claimed` amount


## Summary

ClaimEthPrize checks to ensure that eth is successfully transferred to the claiming address. ClaimERC20Prize neglects to check if the transfer was successful. In the event that ERC20 tokens that don't revert on failure are used, the ERC20Claimed value will be incorrect. This is possible because claimERC20Prize is not restricted to just Footium tokens (per Jordan's QA in discord).

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice attempts to claim X token as a prize
2. X token returns false or void on failure instead of reverting
3. ClaimERC20Prize will be updated but no tokens will be transferred

Tokens such as `ZRX` and `USDT` don't revert on failure.

## Impact

FootiumPrizeDistributor state will show that a user successfully claimed an ERC20 prize when they actually didn't.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommendation is to use openZeppelin SafeERC20 wrapper such as safeTransfer. This will ensure that token transfers revert on failure.
