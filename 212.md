# Approvals for `FootiumEscrow` remain active after the club owner changes

## Summary

Approvals for `FootiumEscrow` remain active after the club owner changes.

## Vulnerability Detail

`FootiumEscrow.sol` has functions that allow the owner of the club to approve a certain address to transfer ERC20 and ERC721 tokens owned by the escrow.

In the event of the club changing ownership, these approvals will remain active.

## Impact

The current owner can give approval to an address he controls to transfer all tokens in the escrow contract and, after selling the club to a new owner, transfer all tokens out of the escrow. Even if there are no approvals created at the time of the club sale, the prior owner can front-run the transaction and create new approvals just before the change in ownership is executed. What is more, the previous owner could approve in advance tokens not yet owned by the escrow and transfer them in the future.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A potential solution would be allowing approval only for a limited number of addresses set by the protocol admins (like certain exchanges) and using the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook of `FootiumClub` contract to revoke all active approvals in `FootiumEscrow`.
