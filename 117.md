# Tx will revert if users try to claim USDT from the FootiumPrizeDistributor contract

## Summary
Tx will revert if users try to claim USDT from the FootiumPrizeDistributor contract

## Vulnerability Detail
- USDT has a non-standard `transfer` function. It doesn't return a boolean, which the IERC20 interface expects, so by using IERC20's `transfer`, it'll expect a boolean and cause a revert to the call.

## Impact
When the ERC20 is USDT, the token claiming will revert upon token transfer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use SafeERC20's `safeTransfer` (and `safeTransferFrom`) for transferring ERC20 tokens, to ensure it works for USDT (and other ERC20 tokens that don't return booleans)
