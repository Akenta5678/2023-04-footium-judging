# `maxGenerationId` + 1 players can be minted per cohort

## Summary

`maxGenerationId` + 1 players can be minted per cohort.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/technical-docs/FootiumAcademy.md#initializeifootiumplayer-footiumplayer-ifootiumclub-footiumclub-address-prizedistributoraddress-uint256-maxgenerationid-uint256-memory-fees-external-initializer) of `FootiumAcademy` it says that `maxGenerationId` is `the number of players that can be minted per cohort`.

However, `maxGenerationId` + 1 players can be minted per cohort, as the only restrictions for each `generationId` are that `generationId > _maxGenerationId` and that the `generationId` has not already been used for the current season.

## Impact

Club owner can mint more players than expected. 
For a `_maxGenerationId` = 2, passing a `generationIds` = [0, 1, 2] will mint 3 players.

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation

```diff
-       if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
+       if (generationId >= _maxGenerationId) {
            revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
        }
```
