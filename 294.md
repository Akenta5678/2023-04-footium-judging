# User eligible for a reward could lose his reward if he gets blacklisted by the reward token contract

## Summary
Certain tokens like USDC and USDT have the ability to blacklist addresses. 

If a user eligible for reward gets blacklisted by the prize token contract(ex. USDC) their prize can be permanently frozen in the FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function has a `_to` parameter for the receiver of the funds but this parameter is practically not used because the first if statement requires that the `_to` parameter should be `msg.sender`.
 
```solidity
    function claimERC20Prize(
        address _to,
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
//here we require that the msg.sender should receive the reward
//making the `_to` parameter basically useless
        if (_to != msg.sender) {
            revert InvalidAccount();
        }
//

        uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];

        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            //here this will fail if `_to` is blacklisted
            _token.transfer(_to, value); 
        }
    }
``` 
## Impact
If a user who is otherwise eligible for a reward gets blacklisted by the token contract, he will lose his reward.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Let the user choose the address to which he wants to claim his reward, like how you intended to do. Remove the if that requires that the msg.sender should be the `_to` address, and perform the totalERC20Claimed checks with the `msg.sender` instead of `_to`
