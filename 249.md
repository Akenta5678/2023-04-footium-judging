# No check for success or failure during transfers

## Summary

FootiumEscrow doesn't check return values of ERC20 transfer functions and some ERC20 tokens do not revert if the transfer failed.

## Vulnerability Detail

FootiumEscrow can transfer any ERC20 tokens, but doesn't check if the transfer succeeded. In case of a failure a transaction will be included in a block without alerting the user of the unsuccessful transfer 

## Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer, which may cause loss of intended functionality, e.g. If a user wants to pay with that tokens for something at a specific time

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A failed token transfer should be catched and that transaction should revert.
