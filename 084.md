# Changes to `FootiumAcademy._maxGenerationId` affects past seasons

## Summary
Because of how checks in `mintPlayers` are implemented, a change to `_maxGenerationId` will also affect past seasons, potentially enabling more players to be minted than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the technical documentation, `maxGenerationId` is defined as "the maximum integer generationId that can be used to mint players. This is the number of players that can be minted per cohort. At game launch this value will be 10."

This value is validated against in `mintPlayers` to ensure that the `generationId` is not greater than `maxGenerationId`.

```solidity
if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
    revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}
```

However, when inspecting the `_validateMintingParams` function, it is observable that an owner can not only mint for the current season, but past seasons as well.

```solidity
uint256 maxSeasonId = SeasonID.unwrap(seasonId) + academyMaxAge - academyMinAge;

if (maxSeasonId < currentSeasonId) {
    revert PlayerTooOld(currentSeasonId);
}
```

This means that if `_maxGenerationId` is changed, it will also affect the number of players that can be minted for past cohorts.

## Impact
Consider the scenario where `_maxGenerationId` is set to 10 for season 1 and 2. Then it is changed to 20 for season 3. This means that 20 players can be minted for season 3. However, because of the way `_validateMintingParams` is implemented, an additional 10 players can also be minted for both season 1 and 2.

By attempting to increase the number of players than can be minted for the season 3 cohort buy 20, you are actually allowing an additional 20 players.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track a separate maximum generation ID for each season. This will allow the number of players than can be minted for each season without affecting past seasons.
