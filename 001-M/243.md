# Unchecked ERC20 token transfer can cause accounting errors and locking of funds.

## Summary
Unchecked ERC20 token transfer can cause accounting errors and locking of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `claimERC20Prize` function in FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol, there is an unchecked ERC20 token transfer:

    if (value > 0) {
        totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
        _token.transfer(_to, value);
    }

Since this transfer is unchecked, the function will not revert even if the transfer fails. If it fails for any reason, the function call will succeed, the accounting will still be updated, and the claimant will be unable to claim their prize.

## Impact
Bricked funds at worst. Permanent accounting errors at best. Technically, the funds could be saved by setting a new Merkle root, but that would cause big accounting issues for all the accounts who did not also have failed claims.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check for successful transfer, as was done in the equivalent function for ETH withdrawals:

For example:

    if (value > 0) {
        totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
        bool success = _token.transfer(_to, value);
        if (!success) {
            revert FailedToSendERC20(value);
        }
    }
