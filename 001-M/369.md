# transferERC20 function in `FootiumEscrow` contract may not work as expected.

## Summary
footium escrow contract uses erc20 transfer method for transferring tokens which may not work for weird erc20 implementations that are standard compliant but work bit different.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a token like `ZRX` that do not revert on failed transfer but rather returns a boolean as false so it needs to be checked to confirm the transaction. Such tokens can cause unexpected behavious in escrow contract.
## Impact
transaction will proceed without transferring the tokens.
