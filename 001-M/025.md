# No check if transfer() operation was successful in FootiumEscrow.sol

## Summary

There is no check provided for transfer() function to check if this operation was successful.

## Vulnerability Detail

If transfer() opcode costs more than 2300 gas it will be reverted. And when you use it to send to a smart contract, the chances are it will cost more and it's considered a bug to use it.

## Impact

Medium-risk vulnerability.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L110

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's better to use low-level calls that don't revert on failure but instead return a boolean value that can be checked. And it's better to use safeTransfer() implementation of transfer() because there some weird ERC20 tokens that can behave unexpectedly.
