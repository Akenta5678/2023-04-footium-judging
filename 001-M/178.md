# `claimERC20Prize` not compatible with some non-standard compliant tokens

## Summary
In `FootiumPrizeDistributor`'s `claimERC20Prize`, if some non-standard compliant ERC20 tokens that return false instead of reverting are being claimed, `claimERC20Prize` will succeed even if the transfer fails, leading to possible loss of funds to users

## Vulnerability Detail
The following code snippet is taken from the `claimERC20Prize` function. First, the `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]` variable is updated, followed by a call to `_token.transfer(_to, value)`. However, there are some non-standard compliant ERC20 tokens that, when a transfer fails, they return false instead of reverting.

In such cases, even if the transfer fails, `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]` would still be updated, but the user would not receive his prize. Furthermore, because `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]` is updated, the user would not be able claim the unreceived prizes by calling `claimERC20Prize` again.

```solidity
uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];

if (value > 0) {
    totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
    _token.transfer(_to, value);
}
```
According to the README, the protocol is designed to be compatible with any ERC20 token. However, if it is used with a token that returns `false` instead of reverting on a failed transfer, such as [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64), it can result in the loss of user funds as described above.

## Impact
As previously mentioned, when using tokens that return false instead of reverting, such as ZRX, calls to `claimERC20Prize` would succeed regardless of whether or not `_token.transfer(_to, value)` is successful. This issue's severity can be considered medium, as it could result in permanent loss of funds for users, but only under specific circumstances. For instance, when users attempt to claim their prizes but the `FootiumPrizeDistributor` lacks sufficient funds.
