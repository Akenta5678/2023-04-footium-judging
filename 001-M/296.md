# Unchecked ERC20 transfers can cause lock up of funds

## Summary
Calls to ERC20::transfer method should always be checked
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failure in transfer but instead return false as a return value (like USDT). Because of this it has become a common practice to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 to handle such weird tokens. If transfer fails, but does not revert it can leave tokens stuck in the contract.


## Impact
Tokens get stuck in the contract

Manual Review

## Recommendation
   Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check
