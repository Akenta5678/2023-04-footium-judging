# Usage of deprecated `transfer` method might lead to lose of funds

## Summary
Usage of deprecated `transfer` method might lead to lose of funds

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (e.g. `ZRX`) do not revert on failure but instead of return false. If a user tries to claim a reward of such token and the transfer fails, the tx will not revert but their `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]` will be updated as if they have successfully claimed the reward. The user will therefore lose all of their reward. 

## Impact
Loss of funds for users.
