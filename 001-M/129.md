# Use safeTransfer instead of transfer

## Summary

`transfer` is used for ERC20 token transfer instead of `safeTransfer`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return false from the transfer function call to indicate the transfer fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

```javascript
        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value); // @audit-issue not using safeTransfer or check return
        }
```

## Impact

Silent failures of transfers can happen and affect token accounting in contract. For example users cannot claim rewards because `totalERC20Claimed` is accounted wrongly.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the SafeERC20 library implementation from OpenZeppelin and call safeTransfer or safeTransferFrom when transferring ERC20 tokens.
