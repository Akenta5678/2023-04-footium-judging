# ERC20 `tranfer()` return value not checked

## Summary

`FootiumPrizeDistributor` use `ERC20.transfer()` to handle fund transfer, but does not check the returned value. Some tokens do not revert on failed function calls and instead return `false`. Other tokens do not return any value.

In this case, it could be that fund is not transferred but with a silent failure, however, the accounting will record the fund as transferred, the user could lose fund.

## Vulnerability Detail

In function `claimERC20Prize()`, the transfer could fail silently, but the `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]` will still be updated, hence in case of non revert transfer failure, the user could not receive the fund and incur loss.

```solidity
File: footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol
106:     function claimERC20Prize(

128:         if (value > 0) {
129:             totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
130:             _token.transfer(_to, value);
131:         }
```


## Impact

Users could lose fund due to erc20 transfer failure without revet.
