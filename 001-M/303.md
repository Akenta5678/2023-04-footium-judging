# ERC20.transfer return value is not check on prize distribution

## Summary
`ERC20.transfer` return value is not check on prize distribution, that could lead to prize being marked as paid but not actually transferred.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens don't revert on transfer failures but just return false instead:

In `FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimERC20Prize` function the claimed value is first increased and then the prize is paid using  the default `ERC20.transfer` function:

## Impact
In case of paying a prize with such a weird ERC20 token, and if the transfer is unsuccessful for some reasons, the contract state would be broken because the `totalERC20Claimed` value would be greater that the amount actually paid. Thus, the prize recipient won't be able to claim the same prize again until the merkle root is re-generated and the granted amount for this recipient is increased.

## Recommendation
You should either wrap the `transfer` with `require` or, better, use the `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` function instead.
