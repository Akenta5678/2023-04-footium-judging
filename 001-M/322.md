# Unchecked Return Values in ERC20 Transfer Function

## Summary
Some contracts do not check the return values of the transfer function. Some ERC20 implementations, such as `USDT`, have their transfer function return void instead of a boolean, which may lead to inconsistencies.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferERC20` function within the `FootiumEscrow` contract and the `claimERC20Prize` within the `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contract fail to verify the return values of the transfer function. Certain ERC20 token implementations return false rather than reverting, which can result in a transaction being executed even when the token transfer has not been successfully completed.

## Impact
The lack of return value verification for the transfer function can lead to unexpected and inconsistent behavior in the in the mentioned contracts. This may result in financial losses or other issues due to unanticipated transfer failures, which could negatively impact the reputation of the platform and discourage users from participating in the ecosystem.

```solidity
function transferERC20(
    IERC20 erc20Contract,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyClubOwner {
    erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
}
```
```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(
    address _to,
    IERC20Upgradeable _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {

    // ...

     if (value > 0) {
        totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
        _token.transfer(_to, value);
    }

    emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it is recommended to use a `require()` statement to verify the return value of the transfer function or to implement the OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20` library, which provides a more secure and consistent token transfer behavior.
