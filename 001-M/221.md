# Use safeTransfer() instead of transfer()

## Summary
The ERC20.transfer() function returns a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (like USDT) don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their transfer/ transferFrom function return void instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert.

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer

```solidity
function transferERC20(
  IERC20 erc20Contract,
  address to,
  uint256 amount
) external onlyClubOwner {
  erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
}
```

```solidity
if (value > 0) {
  totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
  _token.transfer(_to, value);
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer function that handles the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens
