# `FootiumPriceDistributor.sol#claimERC20Price` function is not using `safeTransfer`

## Summary

`FootiumPriceDistributor.sol#claimERC20Price` function is not using `safeTransfer`

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol
128         if (value > 0) {
129             totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
130 >>          _token.transfer(_to, value);
131         }
```

The `claimERC20Price` function will transfer the ERC20 token to the user. The problem here is that `safeTransfer` function is not used and the `_token.transfer(_to, value)` return is not checked. Some token transfers failed but were not recognized. Cause the user may not have received the reward but is considered to have received it.

## Impact

The user's rewards are lost

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use `safeTransfer` function

```diff
        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
-           _token.transfer(_to, value);
+           _token.safeTransfer(_to, value);
        }
```
