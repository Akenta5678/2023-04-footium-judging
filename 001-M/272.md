# Unchecked transfer failure leads to possible accounting error in `FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimERC20Prize` and locked tokens

## Summary
`FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimERC20Prize` does not check for transfer success leading to the possibility that `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]` is increased while the transfer fails and the claiming user does not receive their prize.
In this case, the FootiumPrizeDistributor remains the owner of the tokens and they are locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimERC20Prize`, we have the following code:
```solidity
        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
>           _token.transfer(_to, value); // @audit return value not checked, may have failed with no revert, and claimed amount is already updated
        }
```

The `_token.transfer` call should be checked to ensure the user has received the claimed tokens, ie: that the `transfer` call has not failed, otherwise an accounting error for the claims arises via the update to `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;`.

Note that:

The OpenZeppelin standard for ERC20 tokens states for `transfer`:
> Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-transfer-address-uint256-

However, there are some ERC20 tokens (USDT for example) that do not follow this standard and may behave differently if a `transfer` call fails.

Furthermore, given the absence of functions allowing the contract owner to ERC20 withdraw or modify `totalERC20Claimed`, this cannot be easily corrected.

## Impact
For cases where the ERC20 token transfer fails during the `claimERC20Prize` function call, the user will be unable to claim their due prize. Additionally, the tokens will be locked to the FootiumPrizeDistributor contract address since there is no functionality for the owner to withdraw or approve the spending of excess tokens or reset the claimed values.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A couple of suggestions:
- Use `safeTransfer` from the OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 lib
- Check the balance of the `_to` user before and after the transfer call to ensure the balance has change by the `value` amount.
