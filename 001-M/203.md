# FootiumEscrow.transferERC20 doesn't check the return value of ERC20.transfer

## Summary
FootiumEscrow.transferERC20 doesn't check the return value of ERC20.transfer

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens don't revert on transfer failures but just return `false` instead:

The `FootiumEscrow.transferERC20` function doesn't check the return value on transferring funds, so if the Escrow is dealing with such a weird token, in case of a transfer error the resulting transaction would be successful nevertheless:

## Impact
If the club owner is a EOA, I believe that impact is low. It just can make a mess on transfers when the tx is successful but the funds are still on the Escrow.
If the club owner is a contract and the funds transferring from the Escrow is a part of some logics, it can lead to some wrong assumptions, calculations and losses, in turn.

## Recommendation
You should either wrap transfer with the `require` or, better, to use OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` function instead.
