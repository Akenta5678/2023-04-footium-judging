# Lack of a refund logic of the excess fee, which lead to an unexpected result that the excess fee of the caller will be stuck forever in the FootiumAcademy contract

## Summary
Within the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()` and the FootiumAcademy#`_validateMintingParams()`, there is no refund logic if `msg.value` sent by the caller (of the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()`) would exceed the `totalFee`. 

This lead to an unexpected result that the excess fee of the caller will be stuck forever in the FootiumAcademy contract if `msg.value` sent by the caller would exceed the `totalFee`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()`, the FootiumAcademy#`_validateMintingParams()` would be called to calculate the `totalFee`. Then it will be transferred to the FootiumPrizeDistributor contract like this:

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Mint players corresponding to `generationIds` from the `seasonId` cohort.
     * @param seasonId The season cohort to mint players from.
     * @param clubId The ID of the club to receive the players.
     * @param divisionTier The tier of the division.
     * @param generationIds The unique identifier of each player within the season cohort.
     * @param divisionProof Sibling hashes on the branch from the leaf to the division root of the merkel tree.
     * @dev Only the owner can mint players to their club.
     */
    function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint256 totalFee = _validateMintingParams(  /// @audit
            seasonId,
            clubId,
            divisionTier,
            generationIds,
            divisionProof
        );
        ...

        // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}(""); /// @audit
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
        }
    }
```

Within the FootiumAcademy#`_validateMintingParams()`, the `totalFee` would be calculated and then it would be checked whether or not the `msg.value` sent by the caller (of the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()`) would be greater than the `totalFee`. Finally, the `totalFee` would be returned like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L258-L261
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L271
```solidity
    function _validateMintingParams(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) private returns (uint256) {
        ...
        uint256 playerCount = generationIds.length;
        uint256 totalFee = playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier];  // @audit
        if (msg.value < totalFee) { /// @audit
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
        }
        ...
        return totalFee; // @audit
    }
}
```

However, within both functions, there is no refund logic if `msg.value` sent by the caller (of the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()`) would exceed the `totalFee`. 

## Impact
This lead to an unexpected result that the excess fee of the caller will be stuck forever in the FootiumAcademy contract if `msg.value` sent by the caller would exceed the `totalFee`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()`, consider adding a refund logic if `msg.value` sent by the caller (of the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()`) would exceed the `totalFee` like this:
```solidity
    function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint256 totalFee = _validateMintingParams(  /// @audit
            seasonId,
            clubId,
            divisionTier,
            generationIds,
            divisionProof
        );
        
+       if (msg.value > totalFee) {
+           uint256 excessFee = msg.value - totalFee;
+           address(msg.sender).transfer(excessFee);
+       }
         ...
```
