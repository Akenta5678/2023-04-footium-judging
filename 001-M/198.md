# Transfers can  fail

## Summary
some tokens(like usdt) no implement correctly standar ERC20 and their functions  like transfer/trasnferFrom return void instead true or false,this cause that Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert

## Impact
due that protocol implemente any token this can cause that some tokens leave stuck in the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
