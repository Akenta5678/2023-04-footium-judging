# No check for success or failure during approves

## Summary

FootiumEscrow doesn't check return values of ERC20 approve functions and some ERC20 tokens do not revert if the approval failed.

## Vulnerability Detail

FootiumEscrow can approve any ERC20 tokens, but doesn't check if that approval succeeded. In case of a failure a transaction will be included in a block without alerting the user of the unsuccessful approval.  

## Impact

Users may lose their tokens if, for example, they decide to decrease the amount of approved tokens and the approval fails, but the transaction doesn't revert, a spender can use initial amount of tokens without the user's knowledge.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The function should compare allowance before and after the approval and revert in case of a failure
