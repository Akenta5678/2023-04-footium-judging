# missing return check  and also missing zero check of the recipient address

## Summary

Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false.
tranfser/transferfrom is directly used to send tokens in many places in the contract and the return value is not checked.
If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.

in FootiumEscrow.sol found that is return check and aso missig the zero address in ERC20 token tranasfer

## Vulnerability Detail

the missing return check can allow a transaction to be executed without verifying that the transaction was successful, which can result in a loss of funds for the user. In the case of token transfers

also there is missing zero check of the recipient address can lead to unintended transfers of tokens to the zero address

## Impact

The issue is that the code doesn't use the safeTransferFrom() utility from SafeERC20.
Therefore, profitTokens that don't return a bool in transferFrom() will cause a revert which
means they are stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#LL105C1-L112C1

  function transferERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
