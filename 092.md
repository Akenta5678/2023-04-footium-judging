# Multiple Clubs can buy same player

## Summary

Multiple Clubs are able to buy the same player with the same `generationalId`

## Vulnerability Detail

The `generationalIds` are meant to be the unique identifier of each player within the season cohort. However, different clubs can own players with the same `generationalId`. The same club is prevented from redeeming a player multiple times here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L190-L192
However, `redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]` wouldn't revert if the `clubId` is different.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a check to find out if the `generationId` from a `seasonId` has been purchased.
