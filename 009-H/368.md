# Approve race condition in FootiumEscrow

## Summary

`setApprovalForERC20` function in `FootiumEscrow` is vulnerable to approve race condition that can lead to token theft. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a race condition in the approve() function that is well-known and it may result in the theft of tokens. In case a spender, who has already been granted permission, is called again by a user to approve the function, the spender could possibly execute transferFrom() beforehand, and transfer the previous value, all while still obtaining the authorization to transfer the new value.

## Impact

The club owner will lose tokens from its escrow contract if his second approve call is front-runned.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L75-L81

    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` instead of the `approve` method. This will help prevent users losing funds from front-running attacks.
