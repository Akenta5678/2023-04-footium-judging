# Race Condition on FootiumEscrow#setApprovalForERC20

## Summary

`FootiumEscrow#setApprovalForERC20` is used to approve somebody to spend token. Using `erc20.approve()` is vulnerable to front-running attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The scenario for exploitation is as follows:

1.  ClubOwner calls `FootiumEscrow#setApprovalForERC20(token, Bob, 1000e18)`, allocating 1000e18 tokens for Bob to spend.
2.  ClubOwner opts to change the amount approved for Bob to spend to a lesser amount via `FootiumEscrow#setApprovalForERC20(token, Bob, 500e18)`. Once mined, this decreases the number of tokens that Bob can spend to 500e18.
3.  Bob sees the transaction and calls `token.transferFrom(ClubOwner, bob, 1000e18)` before `FootiumEscrow#setApprovalForERC20(token, Bob, 500e18)` has been mined.
4.  If Bob’s transaction is mined prior to ClubOwner’s, 1000e18 tokens will be transferred by Bob.
5.  However, once ClubOwner’s transaction is mined, Bob can call `token.transferFrom(ClubOwner, bob, 500e18)`, transferring a total of 1500e18 tokens despite ClubOwner attempting to limit the total token allowance to 500e18.

## Impact

FootiumEscrow contract suffered funds loss.

## Recommendation

Two ways to fix this issue:

- Pass the value of allowance[FootiumEscrow][to] from off-chain.

- Use `erc20.increaseAllowance`/`decreaseAllowance` instead of `erc20.approve`.
