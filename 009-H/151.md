# approve() function can be front-ran resulting in token theft

## Summary
The approve() function has a known race condition that can lead to token theft. 

If a user calls the approve function a second time on a spender that was already allowed, the spender can front-run the transaction and call `transferFrom()` to transfer the previous value and still receive the authorization to transfer the new value.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable function is in the FootiumEscrow.sol contract: 
```solidity
    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
``` 
Consider the following scenario:
- The ClubOwner approves Bob(could be a contract) to spend 1000 tokens via the `setApprovalForERC20` function
- After some time, the ClubOwner decided to change Bob's allowance to 500 tokens
- However, Bob monitors the mem pool, sees ClubOwner's transaction for changing allowance, and submits another transaction with higher gas fees to transfer the 1000 tokens for which he already has approval
- Bob's transaction gets mined 1st so he gets the 1000 tokens, then ClubOwner's transaction gets mined so Bob has another 500 tokens approval
- Bob transfers the remaining 500 tokens

In that case, Bob succeeded to spend 1500 tokens while the ClubOwner intended to let him spend a maximum of 500 tokens.
## Impact
It can result in losing tokens from the club contract if the ClubOwner approves tokens to any malicious account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing functionality that allows a ClubOwner to increase and decrease the allowance of spenders. 

This can be done using increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance instead of approve as OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation. Details here:
