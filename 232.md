# Use _safeMint instead of _mint

## Summary
Use _safeMint instead of _mint

## Vulnerability Detail
When generating a club by executing the `FootiumClub.safeMint()` function, `_mint()` is executed in it, which sends the nft of your club to the indicated address, however, if that address does not support ERC721, the nft can be frozen or lost.
```solidity
FootiumClub.sol
      function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
              external
              onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
              nonReentrant
              whenNotPaused
          {
              FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
              clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;
      
              _mint(to, tokenId); 
      
              emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
          }
```

## Impact
Users possibly lose their NFTs

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use _safeMint instead of _mint to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
