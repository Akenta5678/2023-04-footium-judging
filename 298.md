# Transferring ERC20 tokens which return a bool value and don't revert on failure will cause loss of funds for the receiver

## Summary
Transferring ERC20 tokens which return a bool value and don't revert on failure will cause loss of funds for the receiver


## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol supports any ERC20 token and use `transfer` method to transfer the ERC20 token prize to the claimer.
However, some ERC20 tokens do not revert on a failed transfer but only return a bool value (false). In this case, the tx will succeed and totalERC20Claimed is updated although the claimer receives zero amount. 

Note: this is also applicable on FootiumEscrow contract although it has less impact since the owner can re-call `FootiumEscrow.transferERC20` as many as he/she wants.

## Impact
The claimer receives zero amount. totalERC20Claimed is updated for the claimer even though he/she didn't reveive any amount.


## Code Snippet


```solidity
	if (value > 0) {
		totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
		_token.transfer(_to, value);
	}
```

```solidity
    function transferERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
    }

## Recommendation

Use a safe transfer from a library like OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 to avoid  inconsistent handling of ERC20 transfer
