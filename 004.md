# Use of deprecated functions, aliases and keywords

## Summary
Use of deprecated functions, aliases and keywords

## Vulnerability Detail
Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may result in side effects and compile errors.

#### [footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L24)
```solidity
24 :     bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
```
#### [footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L13)

## Recommendation
Solidity provides alternatives to the deprecated constructions.
Most of them are aliases, thus replacing old constructions will not break current behavior.
