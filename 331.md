# Approval Reset to Zero Not Implemented

## Summary

The issue of not resetting the approval to zero before assigning a new value in certain ERC20 tokens, such as USDT. The current implementation may result in insecure ERC20 approval processes and cause some token contracts to revert transactions if the allowance is not set to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

Certain ERC20 tokens, such as USDT, necessitate resetting the approval to zero before assigning a new value. The current implementation of erc20Contract.approve does not follow this practice.

## Impact

This may lead to an insecure ERC20 approval process that does not account for non-standard ERC20 behaviors. Some token contracts may revert the transaction if the allowance is not set to zero.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, it is advised to first set the allowance to zero before increasing it. Additionally, consider using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 utility:

rather than the standard ERC20 implementation:
