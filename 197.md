# Invalid rewards distribution assumption results in reduced rewards

## Summary
The `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contract tracks the amount of tokens/ether claimed by users, but does not consider previous reward distributions, which can result in users receiving reduced rewards or no rewards at all when claiming rewards from multiple distributions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `FootiumPrizeDistributor` facilitates the distribution of rewards to players based on their in-game performance in Footium. It uses Merkle trees to compress the list of players and their rewards, reducing gas costs. Users can claim their rewards by providing a Merkle proof of their prize. The contract also tracks the amount of each token claimed. There are separate Merkle trees for both ETH and ERC20 prizes. The contract keeps track of how much of each token a user has claimed, but it does not consider previous reward distributions. Therefore, if a user claims a reward in the first distribution and then claims a reward in the second distribution for the same token type, they receive an amount reduced by the previous distribution, or will not receive any reward at all.

## Impact
Users who claim rewards from multiple reward distributions for the same token type/ether may receive a reduced amount of tokens or no tokens at all, resulting in loss of rewards.

Letâ€™s assume the following scenario concerning prizes distribution in ether: 
1.  The owner creates the first reward distribution. Alice is allowed to receive 10 ethers.
2.  A Merkle root is then written to the chain, which encodes the total prizes. Alice calls claimETHPrize function with Merkle proof and amount of 10 ethers and she receives 10 ethers.
3. Owner creates a second reward distribution. Alice is allowed to receive 20 ethers.
4. Alice calls claimETHPrize function with markle proof and amount of 20 ethers. However, because of conditions:
`uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];` 
she only receives 10 eth instead of 20, because total ethers that she claimed is 10, due to the previous reward distribution.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a reward distribution mechanism that distinguishes between rewards from different seasons.
