# Previous owner of the club can steal tokens that he approved on

## Summary
The owner can approve his own address to spend ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in `FootiumEscrow.sol`, then sell the club on the secondary market and steal all the funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
[FootiumEscrow.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L75-L96) has 2 approval functions, one for ERC20 and one for ERC721
```solidity
    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
   ...
    function setApprovalForERC721(
        IERC721 erc721Contract,
        address to,
        bool approved
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(to, approved);
    }
```
This lets the club's current owner approve himself as the token spender, then sell the club and still have access to the club's assets.

### Example
Bob is the exploiter/attacker
Alice is the user, who is going to buy the club

1. Bob sets `type(uint).max` to multiple well-known ERC20 (WETH, USDC, USDT etc.) and ERC721 (club players) tokens
2. Bob lists the club on the NFT marketplace
3. Alice sees the listing and buys the club
4. If there are assets that Bob approved on in `FootiumEscrow.sol`, Bob can immediately steal them
5. If Alice doesn't realize, that there has been an approval set by the previous owner on various tokens, all those tokens that get sent to `FootiumEscrow.sol` can get stolen until the approval gets changed.

## Impact
ERC20 and ERC721 tokens can be stolen by the previous owner

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Sets approval for ERC20 tokens.
     * @param erc20Contract ERC20 contract address.
     * @param to The address of token spender.
     * @param amount Token amount to spend.
     * @dev only the club owner address allowed.
     */
    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Sets approval for ERC721 tokens.
     * @param erc721Contract ERC721 contract address.
     * @param to The address of token spender.
     * @param approved Boolean flag indicating whether approved or not.
     * @dev only the club owner address allowed.
     */
    function setApprovalForERC721(
        IERC721 erc721Contract,
        address to,
        bool approved
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(to, approved);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My only recommendation would be to remove `setApprovalForERC20` and `setApprovalForERC721`. In that way, owners cannot set approvals to their own addresses/contracts.
