# `FootiumClub` may mint tokens to a contract which is incapable of handling them

## Summary

`FootiumClub.safeMint` invokes `ERC721Upgradeable._mint` instead of `ERC721Upgradeable._safeMint`. If the recipient address is a contract, the newly minted tokens may be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ERC721Upgradeable._safeMint` contains safety checks to determine if the recipient address is a smart contract and if so, whether it implements the `IERC721ReceiverUpgradeable` interface. These checks ensure that the recipient is prepared to handle ERC721 tokens so that they do not get locked in a naive contract.

However, `FootiumClub.safeMint` uses the plain `ERC721Upgradeable._mint`, which does not contain such checks. If the `_to` address is an unwitting smart contract, the minted tokens will be stuck.

## Impact

Newly minted `FootiumClub` tokens could be lost forever to unprepared smart contract recipients.
