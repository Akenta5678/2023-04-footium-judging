# [M-01] Did not Approve to zero first

medium

## Summary

In the contest Q&A, the Footium protocol states that they expect to be able to interact with any ERC20 tokens. However, they do not anticipate the behavior of non-standard erc20 tokens which require resetting approval to 0 before changing it.  

## Vulnerability Detail


Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s ` approve() ` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

The `erc20Contract.approve(to, amount)` in FootiumEscrow does not reset the approval to 0 before setting it to another value. 

## Impact

Unsafe ERC20 approve that does not handle non-standard erc20 behavior.
1.Some token contracts do not return any value.
2.Some token contracts revert the transaction when the allowance is not zero.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance from OpenZeppelin's safeApprove implementation.
