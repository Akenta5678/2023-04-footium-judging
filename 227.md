# Excessive ETH not refunded to `msg.sender` in FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers() results in lost ETH

## Summary
A victim user may lose ETH, if he sent more ETH than the required `totalFee` for minting Footium players.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumAcademy.sol`, the function `mintPlayers` is used for minting Footium players by the club owners. And based on the number of players he want to mint and the club division tier, the club owner (caller) has to pay a certain amount of fee(`totalFee`).

But the function `mintPlayers` doesn't refund the excessive ETH  sent to the contract. So if the club owner has sent X amt of ETH as `msg.value`, and `X > totalFee`, then in an ideal situation the function should have returned the caller (club owner), the excessive `X-totalFee` amt of ETH, but that doesn't happen here.

## Impact
The club owner (msg.sender) may lose any amount of excessive ETH sent to the contract while calling the function `mintPlayers()`. If we take the above example the `msg.sender` will lose `X-totalFee` amount of ETH.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to return the excessive ETH sent by the `msg.sender` while minting players, or the function can accept `msg.value`, only if it's equal to `totalFee`.
