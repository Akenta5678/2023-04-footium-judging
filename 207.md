# It's impossible to send ERC721 tokens from the Escrow to a EOA

## Summary
The `FootiumEscrow.transferERC721` function will revert if the token recipient is a EOA.

## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumEscrow.transferERC721` uses `ERC721.safeTransferFrom` function to transfer NFTs:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L120-L126

The `ERC721.safeTransferFrom` function "safeness" differs from the one of the ERC20 safe transfer functions.
In case of `ERC721.safeTransferFrom`, the transfer consider being safe if the recipient is a contract conforming the [IERC721Receiver](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver) interface.

Thus, if the recipient is a EOA, it would be impossible to transfer NFT to it.

## Impact
Impact depends on your accepted use-cases. If the NFTs are only may be transferred to other contracts, the impact is absent.
It seems to me, though, that if the NFTs can be send to arbitrary address with no extra checks, then it also should be sendable to the EOAs.

## Recommendation
Consider checking if the recipient is a EOA and, in case of true, using the `ERC721.transferFrom` instead:
