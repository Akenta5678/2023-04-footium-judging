# If the club changes division after a season, they can still mint new academy players with the old proof

## Summary
Since the division tier of a club is not tracked anywhere, and when a club advances to the next division, it will let the owner of the club mint academy players with a lower fee using the old proof if the merkle root hasn't changed. 

Now, the arguments against this might be that the players minted might be of lower quality (because as mentioned in the docs lower division tier players will have lower quality players and vice versa). But, I can't see how the team is going to handle that. There is no onchain code which handles that. And If it is through the front end, then I believe they should emit the divisionTier also. But currently only the following is emitted after an academy player is minted - `emit AcademyPlayerMinted(seasonId, clubId, generationId, playerId);`

And if the next argument is if the team changes the Merkle root after each season. In that case, a person could just frontrun that `setClubDivsMerkleRoot` function transaction and mint before the merkle root is changed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assum alice is a club owner(clubId - 1). Her club is in the 5th division and the season is 2. and assume the fee for minting an academy player is 0.05 ETH. She wants to mint 5 academy players. Also assume [1, 5] is in the merkleroot added by the owner.
 1. She calls the `mintPlayers` with 5 generation ids and the proof so that she can mint the players.
 2. The function succeeds and she gets 5 new academy players.
 3. She finishes first in the league and advances to the next division(4th division) for season 3.
 4. She finds that she can mint more academy players with the same proof since the Merkle root hasn't changed.
 5. Calls the `mintPlayers` and mints some players with lower fees.

```solidity
function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {}
```

## Impact
The amount of fee that the game gets to their prizeDistributor address will be less since each division has different fees.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the division tier for a particular club is not tracked on-chain, it is hard to determine what division tier a club is currently in. So, I do not have a mitigation for this
