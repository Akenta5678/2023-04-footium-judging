# Return of arbitrary ERC20 transfer is not checked in FootiumPrizeDistributor

## Summary
Similar to the issue in `FootiumEscrow.sol`, the return value of erc20.transfer call in `claimERC20Prize()` is not checked in `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` 

## Vulnerability Detail

Several tokens do not revert in case of transfer failure and return `false` instead. If one of these tokens is used here, although transfer fails,`claimERC20Prize()` will not revert and `totalERC20Claimed` for the claimer will be updated falsely and `ClaimERC20` will be fired. If the user tries to re-claim, the tx will revert because of wrong accounting in `totalERC20Claimed`.

## Impact
Some users may be blocked from claiming prizes.

## Recommendation

Require the return value of the transfer to be `true` or use OZ's `SafeERC20` wrapper for ERC20 tokens.
