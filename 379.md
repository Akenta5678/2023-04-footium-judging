# Usage of `transfer()` in place of `safeTransfer()` for ERC20 tokens.

## Summary

It is always recommended to use `safeTransfer()` in place of `transfer()` and additionally check returned value to make sure trasfer executed successfully. Also need to make sure, it the sender's amount is pre-approved.

## Vulnerability Detail
It used in two places -
First in `transferERC20()` of FootiumEscrow :
```solidity
 function transferERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        //!! safeTransfer
        erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
    }
```

and for second time in `claimERC20Prize()`:

```solidity
if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            //!! Use safeTransfer and check returned value.
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }
```

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransfer()` in place of `trasnfer()` and possible check for the returned boolean value.
