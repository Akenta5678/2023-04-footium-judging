# ClaimErc20Prize() continues to operate without proper handling of WeirdERC20/Special ERC20 transfers

## Summary
Transfer() and TransferFrom returns boolean value indicating the state of transaction.
Several ERC20 tokens are written to handle transfer() & transferFrom() differently. Some require return value to validate the status of the transaction whereas others do not have any return value. (USDT, BNB, Tether Gold, etc.). 

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 token do not revert on failure and instead return boolean value. Or throws void instead of boolean (USDT). Some do not adhere to the EIP20 standard as well and revert if provided such parameters of transfer function.

## Impact
ERC20 tokens that fails to transfer the token and returns false as transaction status is still deemed as success. Redeeming token might have failed the transfer but the footium contract still proceeds changing the state of the contract. In which case, the ERC20 token will be unusable/stuck in the contract.

## Tool used
Slither

## Recommendation
Use Openzeppelin's SafeERC20 which handles the return values and also the tokens which are not complaint with EIP20 standard.
