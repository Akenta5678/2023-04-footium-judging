# `FootiumEscrow` has no function for individual NFT approvals

## Summary

The `FootiumEscrow` contract has a function to approve all NFTs for an address, but not for individual NFTs. This could lead to NFTs being stolen when interacting with external exchanges.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [technical documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/technical-docs/General.md#escrow-contracts) states that `FootiumEscrow` is meant to interact with NFT marketplaces to trade NFTs:
> Ultimately, this allows our escrows to interact use NFT marketplaces like the Rarible Protocol

On most NFT marketplaces, the seller has to to approve NFT to sell before placing a sell order. This allows the marketplace contract to transfer the NFT to the buyer. 

As `FootiumEscrow` does not have a function for individual NFT approvals, this can only be done through the [`setApprovalForERC721()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L90-L96) function, which uses `setApprovalForAll()`.

However, such an implementation is dangerous as it allows the approved address to transfer **all** NFTs in the escrow. If the NFT marketplace contract ever becomes malicious or hacked, an attacker could transfer all NFTs in the escrow contract to himself using the approval.

## Impact

Users might lose all their NFTs if they sell NFTs from their club's escrow on external exchanges.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a function for individual NFT approvals:

```solidity
function approveERC721(
    IERC721 erc721Contract,
    address to,
    uint256 tokenId
) external onlyClubOwner {
    erc721Contract.approve(to, tokenId);
}
```
