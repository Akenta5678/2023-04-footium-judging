# Renouncing ownership would affect the normal operation of Footium

## Summary

Abnormal operation of protocol if/when ownership gets renounced

## Vulnerability Detail

All the contracts that extend from OwnableUpgradeable inherit a method called
renounceOwnership. The owner of the contract can use this method to give up their ownership, thereby leaving
the contract without an owner. If that were to happen, it would not be possible to perform any owner-specific
functionality on that contract anymore.
Under the code snippet is a list of all affected contracts and their impact if the ownership has been renounced.

## Impact

Inability to perform any owner-specific
functionality in all contracts under `footium-eth-shareable` asided `FootiumEscrow`, since owner is now `0x0`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Review if the renounceOwnership function is required for each of the affected contracts and remove them if they are not needed. Ensure that renouncing ownership in any of the affected contracts will not affect the normal operation of Footium
