# Signature malleability in FootiumEscrow.sol

## Summary

Front-running using the signature malleability.

## Vulnerability Detail

call to the isValidSignature can be easily seen in the mempool and be front-runned with the same parameters that return magic value.

## Impact

This can be used by attacker to impersonate himself as an owner and to confirm that he's the owner. It can be used to get the magic value and to make owner operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The protocol needs to make sure that expired signatures cannot be used again and again. It can be done by storing them in some kind of mapping or in some kind of storage variable. Also, it can be done by adding uniqueness (nonce, timestamp) to the signed hash message.
