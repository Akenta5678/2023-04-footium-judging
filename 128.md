# Ownership of the `FootiumPlayer` /`FootiumClub`contracts can be changed, thus making minter roles become useless

Ownership of the `FootiumPlayer` /`FootiumClub`contracts can be changed, thus making minter roles become useless

## Summary

Window to side step `MINTER_ROLE` due to implementation of the `grantRole()` function of `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Initializes the FootiumClub contract.
     * @param baseURI Footium Club  token base metadata URI.
     */
    function initialize(string memory baseURI) external initializer {
        __ERC721_init("FootiumClub", "FFC");
        __AccessControl_init();
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
        __Ownable_init();

        _base = baseURI;
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
```

The below medium finding explains in more detail how this is vulnerably, though in the case below it's a CURATOR_ROLE instead of a MINTER_ROLE, and curators are allowed to mint editions, where as in this case any on'e that's been granted the MINTER_ROLE could mint a club

## Impact

The MINTER_ROLE could be side stepped leading to unathorized users being able to mint football clubs

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

You could override the `grantRole()` function of `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol` with something like:

```solidity
function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) internal override {
    revert("Admins can't be chagned");
}
```

This will disable the granting of roles after initialization. The initialization function already has the required granting of roles done and they cannot be changed after this fix.
