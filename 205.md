# Claiming ERC20 tokens fails silently while claimable token count is still decreased due to ERC20 token not reverting on failed transfer

## Summary

The **claimERC20Price** function in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L106 will update the already claimed token for a user although the actual ERC20 token transfer failed.

This leads to wrong accounting to the disadvantage of the user who looses his price.

## Vulnerability Detail

The implementation of the `claimERC20Price` function in `FootiumEscrow.sol` tracks the already claimed tokens for the user at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L129.

After that the ERC20 token transfer is executed at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L130.

The implementation assumes that the token conforms to https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20Upgradeable.sol#L41 and returns a boolen value indicating a successful or failed token transfer. E.g. the projects own ECC20 token implemented in`FootiumToken.sol` conforms to this.

But the return value is not used and interpreted to revert in case of a failed token transfer. The implementer may have assumed that a failed transfer call will revert.

A failed token transfer is nevertheless tracked as success by emitting the `ClaimERC20` event in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L133.

A second thought is that the `claimERC20Price` function is implemented generically to support ERC20 tokens in general and not only the ERC20 implemented via `FootiumToken.sol`.

Different ERC20 tokens implement the `transfer` function differently to indicate success or failure of a token transfer. This ambiguity needs to be addressed to make a generic support of ERC20 tokens more robust.

## Impact

A failed transfer will deny the user receiving his ERC20 price while still tracking that the user successfully claimed his price.
There will also be a discrepancy between on-chain and off-chain bookkeeping of claimed ERC20 prizes.

## Recommendation

Use the `safeTransfer` function of OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 implementation to handle the return value check and non-standard-compliant ERC20 tokens: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L26. In this way all failed transfers will revert.
