# approve function can fail for non standard ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Just like transfer, some tokens approve method does not returns boolean which could cause token approves to fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
Certain tokens do not return a boolean value for their approve functions (e.g., USDT). To successfully handle approvals for these tokens, either the safeApprove method should be utilized, or the approve method should be invoked using a more broadly scoped interface.

By making these adjustments, your smart contract can interact with various tokens, including those that do not strictly adhere to the ERC20 standard. This ensures compatibility and consistency when dealing with token approvals, even when working with non-standard tokens.
