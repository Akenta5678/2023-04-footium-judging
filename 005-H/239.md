# Club owner can mint more players than  _maxGenerationId

## Summary
The owner of a club can mint more tokens than `_maxGenerationId` using the `mintPlayers` function of the `FootiumAcademy` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [technical doc](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/technical-docs/FootiumAcademy.md#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20number%20of%20players%20that%20can%20be%20minted%20per%20cohort.%20At%20game%20launch%20this%20value%20will%20be%2010.) and the [wiki](https://footium.gitbook.io/footium-wiki/assets-breakdown/clubs/academy#:~:text=Your%20club%20starts%20with%2010%20players%20in%20its%20academy.%20Every%20season%2010%20new%20players%20are%20generated%20into%20your%20academy%2C%20ready%20to%20be%20introduced%20to%20the%20professional%20game.) specify that every season 10 players can be minted through the academy by the club owner. The variable ` _maxGenerationId` is the maximum number of players that can be minted per cohort and is set to 10 initially (refer to technical doc). But, a club owner can mint 1 token more than `_maxGenerationId`. If the club owner gives  `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`  as an input in the form of `generationIds` to the `mintPlayers` function, then it results in the club owner minting 11 players as NFTs from the academy, one more than the initial value of `_maxGenerationId`, which is not intended.

## Impact
This would result in a malicious club owner minting one player token more than other club owners, which would be unfair to the other players of the game.

## Code Snippet
The [mintPlayers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166) function in the `FootiumAcademy` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Some sanity checks can work here: 

`require(generationIds.length <=  _maxGenerationId)` 

Note, this check should go along with `require(generationIds[i]  <= _maxGenerationId)` in the for loop of the `mintPlayers` function. This [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L186) already exists.
