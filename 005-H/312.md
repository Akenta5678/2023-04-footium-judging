# Wrong check in mintPlayers() function allows mint more players

## Summary
Wrong check in mintPlayers() function allows mint more players

## Vulnerability Detail
From the documentation, we can see that users should be able to mint 10 players.
>`maxGenerationId`: The maximum integer `generationId` that can be used to mint
  players. This is the number of players that can be minted per cohort. At game
  launch this value will be 10.

However, the following check is incorrect, as it always allows minting 11 players instead of the intended 10.
```solidity
if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
        revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}
```
`generationIds` is an array. Loop begin counting from 0
```solidity
uint256 generationId;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {
```
Because of the first index in an array is zero the check will only revert when generationId is 11 allowing users to mint more players

## Impact
User can mint more players than he should be

## Code Snippet
```solidity
if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
        revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `generationId > _maxGenerationId` to `generationId >= _maxGenerationId`
