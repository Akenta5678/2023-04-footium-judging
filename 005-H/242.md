# Club owner can mint 1 player more than maxGenerationId

## Summary
Club owner can mint 1 player more than maxGenerationId due to lack of input validation

## Vulnerability Detail
As per documentation, maxGenerationId - `is the number of players that can be minted per cohort. At game launch this value will be 10`. Club owner can mint 1 player more than this number

For example, if maxGenerationId = 10, then a user can send this array in `mintPlayers` function - `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` - and mint  himself 11 players.

## Impact
Club owner will have more players than allowed

```solidity
if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
  revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the validation to this:

```diff
-if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
+if (generationId >= _maxGenerationId) {
  revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}
```

Or make sure the generationId > 0

```diff
-if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
+if (generationId == 0 || generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
  revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}
```
