# Increasing `_maxGenerationId` allows extra minting of academy players on previous seasons

## Summary

`_maxGenerationId` is defined in the [Footium Academy docs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/technical-docs/FootiumAcademy.md#initializeifootiumplayer-footiumplayer-ifootiumclub-footiumclub-address-prizedistributoraddress-uint256-maxgenerationid-uint256-memory-fees-external-initializer) as:

> `maxGenerationId`: The maximum integer generationId that can be used to mint players. This is the number of players that can be minted per cohort.

Due to a lack of checks, if `maxGenerationId` is increased, it is possible to mint extra players.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_validateMintingParams` allows minting on previous seasons:

```solidity
    if (SeasonID.unwrap(seasonId) <= 0) {
        revert InvalidSeasonId(seasonId);
    }

    if (SeasonID.unwrap(seasonId) > currentSeasonId) {
        revert PlayerTooYoung(seasonId);
    }
```

`mintPlayers` doesn't enforce a limit of minted players per season either:

```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {
        generationId = generationIds[i];

        if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
            revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
        }

        if (redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]) {
            revert PlayerAlreadyRedeemed(generationId);
        }

        redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId] = true;

        uint256 playerId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
            _footiumClub.clubToEscrow(clubId)
        );

        emit AcademyPlayerMinted(seasonId, clubId, generationId, playerId);

        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }
```

Those two factors combined are the reason for the bug.

Add this test to `FootiumAcademy.test.ts` to prove how extra players can be minted on previous seasons if `_maxGenerationId` is increased (it doesn't only affect the current season).

```typescript
    it.only("mints extra players for past seasons when maxGenerationId is increased", async () => {
        // Set season 1
        await expect(academy.changeCurrentSeasonId(1))
            .to.emit(academy, "ChangedCurrentSeasonId")
            .withArgs(1);

        const maxGenerationId = 3; // @audit max 3 players
        await expect(academy.changeMaxGenerationId(maxGenerationId))
            .to.emit(academy, "ChangedMaxGenerationId")
            .withArgs(maxGenerationId);

        //const token = [clubId = 7, division = 4]
        const clubDivProof = clubDivsTree.getHexProof(
            hashClubDivisionInputs([7, 4])
        );

        const divisionTier = 4;
        const generationIds = [0, 1, 2]; // @audit mint 3 players
        const ethAmount = ethers.BigNumber.from(divisionFees[0]).mul(
            generationIds.length
        );

        await expect(
            academy
                .connect(addr1)
                .mintPlayers(
                    1,
                    7,
                    divisionTier,
                    generationIds,
                    clubDivProof,
                    {
                        value: ethAmount,
                    }
                )
        ).to.not.reverted;

        // Advance to season 2
        await expect(academy.changeCurrentSeasonId(2))
            .to.emit(academy, "ChangedCurrentSeasonId")
            .withArgs(2);

        // Increase the generation length to 6
        // It should only affect the current generation, but it affect the past ones in fact as well
        const newMaxGenerationId = 6; // @audit max 6 players
        await expect(academy.changeMaxGenerationId(newMaxGenerationId))
            .to.emit(academy, "ChangedMaxGenerationId")
            .withArgs(newMaxGenerationId);

        const extraGenerationIds = [3, 4, 5]; // @audit mint 3 more players

        await expect(
            academy
                .connect(addr1)
                .mintPlayers(
                    1, // @audit mint for the previous season
                    7,
                    divisionTier,
                    extraGenerationIds, // @audit extra players
                    clubDivProof,
                    {
                        value: ethAmount,
                    }
                )
        ).to.not.reverted;

        // It was possible to mint three extra players on the previous season
    });
```

## Impact

Extra academy players can be minted bypassing the expected limitations.

## Recommendation

Define a `_maxGenerationId` limit per season and check it accordingly.
