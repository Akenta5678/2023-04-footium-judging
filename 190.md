# `FootiumAcademy.sol#setDivisionFees` function does not record the upper limit of the fee list

## Summary

`FootiumAcademy.sol#setDivisionFees` function does not record the upper limit of the fee list

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: FootiumAcademy.sol
115     function setDivisionFees(uint256[] memory _fees) public onlyOwner {
116         uint256 max = _fees.length;
117
118         for (uint256 i = 0; i < max; ) {
119             uint256 fee = _fees[i];
120             divisionToFee[i + 1] = fee;
121
122             unchecked {
123                 i++;
124             }
125         }
126
127         emit ChangedDivisionFees(_fees);
128     }
```

The `setDivisionFees` function is used to set the mint fee of each division. The map `divisionToFee` is used to store the mint fee of each division, and all divisions that have not been set can still be queried for mint fee. For example, when `division = 100`, `divisionToFee[100]` is `0`.

There may be some problems, for example, it is impossible to query how many divisions exist through the contract, and it is also impossible to check whether the `divisionTier` entered by the user is legal.

The user may mint a player in a division that no longer exists:

1. ClubA has the proof of minting players whose division tier is 100 
2. Division tier 100 is cancelled, the admin sets `divisionToFee[100]` to 0
3. ClubA can mint players whose division tier is 100 for free, because the contract cannot know that division tier 100 is illegal

## Impact

Clubs may mint illegal division players

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to record the upper limit value of the division for check

```diff
+   uint256 max;
+   function getDivisionMax() public view returns uint256 {
+       return max;
+   }

    function setDivisionFees(uint256[] memory _fees) public onlyOwner {
-       uint256 max = _fees.length;
+       max = _fees.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < max; ) {
            uint256 fee = _fees[i];
            divisionToFee[i + 1] = fee;

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }

        emit ChangedDivisionFees(_fees);
    }
```
