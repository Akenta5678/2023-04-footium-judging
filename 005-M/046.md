# transfer can fail for non standard ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Some tokens does not have return values as booleans which would fail if its used with IERC20(address).transfer. To mitigate this safeTransfer should be used.
## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in summary, due to some Non standard ERC20-s not returning boolean in transfers, it is best to use safeTransfer instead of transfer. In case of these tokens (i.e: USDT) received by the contract, tokens will be stucked forever since transfer will not go through
