# USDT tokens can be stuck in FootiumEscrow contract

## Summary
USDT tokens can be stuck in FootiumEscrow contract. (ClubOwner won't be able to set approval or transfer tokens for USDT tokens in Footium Escrow)

## Vulnerability Detail
- USDT has a non-standard `approve` & `transfer` function implementation. Specifically it doesn't return a boolean, but the IERC20's interface expects a boolean. So, the the compiled bytecode will try to decode the boolean return value and cause a tx revert.

## Impact
- `setApprovalForERC20` in FootiumEscrow  will always revert fail on USDT token --> USDT cannot be approved to any other address.
- `transferERC20` in FootiumEscrow will always revert fail on USDT token --> USDT cannot be directly transferred out to another address.
