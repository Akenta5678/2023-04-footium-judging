# Claiming two different prizes of the same type from `FootiumPrizeDistributor` fails to deliver full prize amount

## Summary

The `FootiumPrizeDistributor` provides two methods for users to claim prizes: `claimERC20Prize(address _to, IERC20Upgradeable _token, uint256 _amount, bytes32[] calldata _proof)` and `claimETHPrize(address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes32[] calldata _proof)`. These methods keep track of the amounts already claimed by a specific address.

However, when two prizes of different amounts are allocated to the same account in the Merkle tree, and the user claims the larger amount first, the subsequent claim of the smaller prize fails. Conversely, if the smaller prize is claimed first, the subsequent claim of the larger prize will not yield its full amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the implementation of `claimETHPrize`, which also applies to `claimERC20Prize`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L163

When there are two prizes of different amounts allocated to the same account in the Merkle tree, and the user claims the larger amount first, the subsequent claim of the smaller prize fails. This is because the `amount` minus `totalETHClaimed[_to]`, which equals an amount greater than `amount`, will result in a negative value, causing the function to panic due to arithmetic underflow.

## Impact

The user is unable to claim both prizes. 

If the larger amount is claimed first, the subsequent claim for the smaller amount will fail, leaving the smaller prize unclaimable. 

If the smaller amount is claimed first, the subsequent claim of the larger amount is always reduced by the previously claimed smaller amount, leaving the remainder of the larger prize unclaimable.

This issue is classified as a medium risk as it "causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states."

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Ensure each `_to` address is always associated with only one prize 
- or add another abstraction layer to the claim functions, such as a `prizeId`.
