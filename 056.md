# FootiumClub's safeMint() uses unsafe _mint()

## Summary
Unsafe version of ERC721's `_mint()` may mint NFTs to unsupported accounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumClub.sol`s `safeMint()` uses unsafe `_mint()` which does not call `_checkOnERC721Received()` on the target address. This may cause confusion since the function is called `safeMint()` but performs an unsafe mint and Club NFTs can be minted to smart contract accounts that are not capable of handling NFTs.


## Impact
NFTs may get stuck in accounts that are not able handle them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `safeMint()` in `FootiumClub.sol` to use underlying `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()`
