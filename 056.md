# Users can be blocked from minting players from previous seasons

## Summary
Use of updatable `_maxGenerationId` may block some users from minting players from past seasons.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_maxGenerationId` is updatable via `changeMaxGenerationId()`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L94-L97

This variable is used in `mintPlayers()` to limit the amount of mintable players:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L186-L188

Since the check is made by the `generationId` instead of count of the minted players, this may cause certain users to be blocked from minting players from past seasons.

Consider this case:
`_maxGenerationId` = 10
`SeasonID` = 1
User Alice mints players with ids [0,1,2,3,4,5]
User Bob mints players with ids [6,7,8,9,10]

Next season comes:
Admin calls `changeMaxGenerationId(5)` and `changeCurrentSeasonId(2)`

`_maxGenerationId` = 5
`SeasonID` = 2

In this season Bob can mint 6 players from Season1 and 6 players from Season2, in total 12 players.
But Alice can only mint 6 players from Season2 and her mintable players from Season1 can not be minted anymore because the `_maxGenerationId` is used for all seasons and blocks legit Seasons1 mints

## Impact
May block some users from minting players. Medium Impact, Low probability.

## Code Snippet
PoC

```typescript
const generationIds = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const ethAmount = ethers.BigNumber.from(divisionFees[0]).mul(
    generationIds.length
);

await expect(
    academy
        .connect(addr1)
        .mintPlayers(
            1,
            7,
            divisionTier,
            generationIds,
            clubDivProof,
            {
                value: ethAmount,
            }
        )
).to.not.reverted;
await academy.changeCurrentSeasonId(2);

await academy.changeMaxGenerationId(5);



await expect(
  academy
      .connect(addr1)
      .mintPlayers(
          1,
          7,
          divisionTier,
          [7, 8, 9, 10],
          clubDivProof,
          {
              value: ethAmount,
          }
      )
).to.not.reverted;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store how many players minted per team for each seasons, and check if thats bigger than the specific seasons maxMint count.
