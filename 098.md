# EIP2981 not properly implemented - setTokenRoyalty is missing

## Summary

EIP2981 not properly implemented - setTokenRoyalty is missing

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract states in their technical docs: 

```md
The contract also implements the ERC2981 standard for royalty payments on sales, allowing the owner of the contract to receive a percentage of the sale.
```

However, in the code _setDefaultRoyalty() is used instead of _setTokenRoyalty() from the OpenZeppelin contract

```solidity
    function setRoyaltyInfo(address _receiver, uint96 _royaltyFeePercentage)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        _setDefaultRoyalty(_receiver, _royaltyFeePercentage);
    }
 ```
 

## Impact

This could cause confusion for artists causing them to miss-configure/not set their royalties and loss out on the funds they intend to make.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a public function setTokenRoyalty() to allow creators set token level royalty.
