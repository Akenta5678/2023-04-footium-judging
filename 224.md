# Cannot receive if Owner is a Smart Contract that doesn't implement receive

## Summary

`withdraw` will revert if the owner is a Smart Contract without a `receive` function

## Vulnerability Detail

Becase `withdraw` hardcodes the recipient, the function could fail, it may be best to allow the `owner` to specify whom to sweep to.

## Impact

## Code Snippet

Especially for Owner

```solidity
            (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");

```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow the `owner` to pass a `recipient` parameter as a way to allow them to transfer funds
