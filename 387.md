# Excess ETH Sent By Caller(Buyer) While Buying Players Are Stolen By Owner Of Contract

## Summary
Excess Eth sent by caller will lost

## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumAcademy` Contract there is function `mintPlayers()` which used to call by ClubOwner to Buy players from academy.
Which calls a private function `_validateMintingParams()` where it checks `ETH send by caller is not less than total players cost`
```solidity
 function _validateMintingParams(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) private returns (uint256) {
        ....................
        ......................
        uint256 playerCount = generationIds.length;
        uint256 totalFee = playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier];
        if (msg.value < totalFee) { // @audit-issue excess eth of user will lost
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
        }

      ..........................................

```
So if user sent some extra ETH than players net cost then these extra ETH will remain in that Academy contract, and it will withdrawn by Owner via `withdraw()` function
```solidity
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```
## Impact
If more Eth sent by Caller(i.e more than players fee), then those extraa eth will be withdrawn by Owner of contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Technically if any caller send more eth than sum of all players fee those he intended to Buy, Contract should return extra ETH to that caller 
```solidity
 function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint256 totalFee = _validateMintingParams(
            seasonId,
            clubId,
            divisionTier,
            generationIds,
            divisionProof
        );

        uint256 generationId;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {
            generationId = generationIds[i];

            if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
                revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
            }

            if (redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]) {
                revert PlayerAlreadyRedeemed(generationId);
            }

            redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId] = true;

            uint256 playerId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
                _footiumClub.clubToEscrow(clubId)
            );

            emit AcademyPlayerMinted(seasonId, clubId, generationId, playerId);

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }

        // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
+      uint256 remain = msg.value - totalFee;
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}(""); // @audit excess ETH sent by user will lost
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
        }
+     if(remain != 0){
+          (bool succ, ) = msg.sender.call{value: remain}(""); 
+            require(succ, "BIng Bong, Bing Bong");
+   } 
    }
```
