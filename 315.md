# Address is not set as payable.

## Summary
In contract `FootiumPrizeDistributor` and `FootiumAcademy` the to variable to which the eth is to be sent is not payable which can cause the eth to be lock in contract and not sent to the users/winners. 

## Vulnerability Detail
POC:
```solidity
contract A {
    uint256 public amount;

    function hello() payable external returns(address) {
        amount = msg.value;
    }

    function check(address to) public payable {
        uint256 bal = address(this).balance;
        amount = bal;
        (bool sent, ) = to.call{value: bal}("");
        require(sent, "unable to send");
    }

    function anotherCheck(address to) public payable {
        uint256 bal = address(this).balance;
        amount = bal;
        (bool sent, ) = payable(to).call{value: bal}("");
        require(sent, "unable to send");
    }

    function checkUser() public view returns(uint256) {
        return address(msg.sender).balance;
    }
}
```
## Impact
If the address is not set as payable the eth transfer may fail
