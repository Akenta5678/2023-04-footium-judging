# Lack of protection against userâ€™s overpayment

## Summary
The `FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers` function does not handle overpayment, which can result in users losing funds if they accidentally send more ether than required for purchasing players.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers` function enables users to mint players for their club. It calls the `_validateMintingParams` internal function, which verifies if the specified conditions have been met. This includes checking if the transaction ether value is sufficient to purchase the required number of players. However, if a user accidentally sends more ether than required, they will lose those funds and will not receive the corresponding number of players in return.
## Impact
The vulnerability could result in the user losing funds and potentially leading to mistrust in the system.

## Recommendation
* Change the msg.value check as follow:
```solidity
       if (msg.value != totalFee) {
           revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
       }
```   
or

* Calculate and refund overpayment amounts to callers
