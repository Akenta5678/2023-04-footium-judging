# FootiumEscrow.setApprovalForERC20() is vulnerable to front-running attacks

## Summary
Setting approval for ERC-20 tokens directly can lead to front-running attacks, that allow an attacker to spend more tokens than intended by the user.
## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumEscrow.setApprovalForERC20()` does an external call to the ERC-20 `approve()` function, which sets the allowance for a spender address. If a user intends to decrease the allowance for a particular spender address, they would call `setApprovalForERC20()` with a lower `amount`. 

### Example
Alice has approved Bob to spend 100 RON token units but wants to reduce the amount to 50 token units. To do this, Alice would need to call `FootiumEscrow.setApprovalForERC20()` where `amount = 50`.
Bob can front-run Alice's transaction to spend the initial allowance of 100 RON tokens, then back-run Alice's approval transaction to spend another 50.
## Impact
The spender can spend more tokens than the token holder intends to allow for.
In the example given above, Bob was able to spend 150 of Alice's RON tokens even though Alice intended to allow Bob to only spend 50.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add functions that allow the user to call `increaseAllowance()` and `decreaseAllowance()` from the escrow contract. OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library has wrapper functions `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()` that can be used to account for tokens that don't return a `bool` value.
