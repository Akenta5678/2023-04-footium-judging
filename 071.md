# Users can lose funds

## Summary
When calling `mintPlayers()` method users can lose funds

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `mintPlayers()` method the user has to send eth to pay the players' fees. Then in `_validateMintingParams()` method(called by `mintPlayers()`) there is a check if the eth sent by the user is enough to cover the fees.
```solidity
if (msg.value < totalFee) {
    revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
}
```

## Impact
The issue is that the user can accidentally send more than `totalFee` and won't be able to get it back.

```solidity
if (msg.value < totalFee) {
    revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a strict comparison check
```solidity
if (msg.value != totalFee) {
    revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
}
```
