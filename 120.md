# Tokens may be minted to non ERC721 receivers as mint is being used in FootiumClub.sol

## Summary
Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail
The  safeMint in  uses _mint rather than _safeMint and does not check that the receiver accepts ERC721 token transfers.

## Impact
Clubs possibly lose their NFTs

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeMint instead of mint to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.

However, note that calling _safeMint introduces a reentrancy opportunity! If you make this change, ensure that the mint is treated as an interaction rather than an effect, and consider adding a reentrancy guard.
