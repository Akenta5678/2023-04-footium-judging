# Low-level transfer via call() can fail silently

## Summary

In a few functions in scope calls are executed with the following code:

```solidity
            (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(value);
            }
```

Per the Solidity docs:

```solidity
The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.
```

Therefore, transfers may fail silently.

## Vulnerability Detail

Please find the documentation here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions

## Impact

Cause protocl implements transfer on a low-level via call(), this could fail silently.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check for the account's existence prior to transferring.
