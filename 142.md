# Spender is allowed to transfer more tokens than the owner of the tokens ever wanted to allow the spender to spend

## Summary
The [setApprovalForERC20()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L75-L81) uses the approve() of the ERC20 standard and doesn't reset the total allowance to 0 before updating the new value.
A malicious user can take advantage of this and perform a transaction order to end up spending more tokens than the total tokens the owner intended to allow this user to spend, a more detailed example is in the "Vulnerability Detail" Section.

You can refer to this thread about this transaction ordering caused by the approve() of the EIP20 proposal
- https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is a possible attack scenario:
1. Alice allows Bob to transfer N of Alice's tokens (N>0)  by calling the approve method on a Token smart contract, passing the Bob's address and N as the method arguments
2. After some time, Alice decides to change from N to M (M>0) the number of Alice's tokens Bob is allowed to transfer, so she calls the approve method again, this time passing the Bob's address and M as the method arguments
3. Bob notices the Alice's second transaction before it was mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the transferFrom method to transfer N Alice's tokens somewhere
4. If the Bob's transaction will be executed before the Alice's transaction, then Bob will successfully transfer N Alice's tokens and will gain an ability to transfer another M tokens
5. Before Alice noticed that something went wrong, Bob calls the transferFrom method again, this time to transfer M Alice's tokens.
6. So, an Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from N to M (N>0 and M>0) made it possible for Bob to transfer N+M of Alice's tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob.

## Impact
- A spender can abuse and transfer more tokens than the owner of the tokens ever wanted to allow the spender to spend by performing a transaction ordering attack.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards. Additionally make sure to check the returned value to ensure that the allowance was indeed updated as expected
```solidity
function setApprovalForERC20(
    IERC20 erc20Contract,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyClubOwner {
+   require(erc20Contract.approve(to, 0),"Error while reseting the approval amount to 0");
    require(erc20Contract.approve(to, amount),"Error while granting the desired allowance to the spender");
}
```
