# Use safeTransfer() instead of transfer() for ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Project explicitly aims to be used with arbitrary ERC20 tokens, hence must use safeTransfer() instead of transfer(). Also doesn't check the return of transfer() either which could be problematic!

## Vulnerability Detail
Using transfer() will have problems with non-standard ERC20 tokens.

## Impact
Potential issues with non-standard ERC20 tokens and not checking the return of transfer() could be problematic if transfer() fails but doesn't revert & code continues executing as if it had succeeded.

## Code Snippet
