# User can lost his rewards

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol contract has two functions to claim rewards claimETHPrize and claimERC20Prize.
In both functions we have the following statement:
```solidity
uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];
```
Consider the situation:

For example user earned 4 ETH as rewards. He calls `claimETHPrize` with 4 ETH amount and successfully claims rewards.
`totalETHClaimed[_to]` value increased by 4 ETH
`totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;`
The second time user earned only 3 ETH and when he calls claimETHPrize the following statement reverts due to underflow (value = 3 - 4;).
```solidity
uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];
```
Now user is unable to receive rewards 
Then, the owner can change the merkleRoot to a new one, and the user will lose their rewards
```solidity
function setETHMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {
        ethMerkleRoot = _merkleRoot;

        emit SetETHMerkleRoot(ethMerkleRoot);
    }
```
This issue is persists with ERC20 tokens as well
