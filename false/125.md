# The exceeded ETH amount sent by club owner cannot be returned

## Summary

When sending ETH to mint players in the FootiumAcademy contract, the msg.value is checked by `(msg.value < totalFee)`. If the `msg.value` is greater than `totalFee`, the excess amount is not refunded and remains in the contract until the owner withdraws it.

## Vulnerability Detail

When sending ETH to mint players in the FootiumAcademy contract, the `msg.value` is checked as follows:

```javascript
        if (msg.value < totalFee) {
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
        }
```

If `msg.value > totalFee`, the `totalFee` is sent to the `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contract. The excess amount stays in the FootiumAcademy contract and can be withdrawn later by the contract owner. The user cannot get back the excess amount.

```javascript
    function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Users lose excess ETH amount to contract owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Option 1: Check msg.value == totalFee

```diff
-        if (msg.value < totalFee) {
+        if (msg.value != totalFee) {
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
        }
```

Option 2: Return the exceeded amount to users. For example:

```diff
+        uint256 refund = msg.value - totalFee;
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
        }
+        if (refund > 0) {
+            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: refund}("");
+            if (!sent) {
+                revert FailedToSendETH(refund);
+            }
+        }
