# Excess ETH is lost when minting players as the implementation is missing refund and withdraw functionality

## Summary

When paying for minting players in `FootiumAcademy.sol` ETH needs to be sent to cover the associated minting fee. But if too much ETH is sent for minting, excess ETH is not automatically refunded to the sender. And there is also no option to withdraw stuck ETH for the sender. So that ETH is lost for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calling the `mintPlayers` function in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166 sufficient ETH has to be provided to cover the `totalFee` calculated here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L258.

There is no check that the caller of the message provided the exact ETH that matches the calculated `totalFee`. It is only checked that sufficient ETH is provided: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L259 which fails with an `IncorrectETHAmount` if not enough ETH was provided.

Remaining ETH is not calculated and after the transfer of the `totalFee` to the `_prizeDistributorAddress` in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L208 no refund of excess ETH is implemented. 

Also which excssive ETH belongs to which sender is not tracked for the `msg.sender` in the `FootiumAcademy.sol` contract. So if excessive ETH accumulates in the `FootiumAcademy.sol` it needs to be reverse engineered which ETH belongs to which account. No function to withdraw his excessive ETH is available for a user.

## Impact

Excessive ETH sent for minting players is not recoverable for the user and therefore lost.

## Recommendation

There are 2 convenient options to make excessive ETH unstuck for the user in a convenient fashion.

Option 1: Immediate refund of excessive ETH back to the msg.sender at the end of the `mintPlayers` call. See an adapted `mintPlayers` function below:

```Solidity
function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
       
        // added to the end of the function
        uint256 refund = msg.value - totalFee;
        if (refund > 0) {
            (bool sentToMsgSender, ) = msg.sender.call{value: refund}("");
            if (!sentToMsgSender) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
            }
        }
    }
```

Option 2: Track excessive ETH per `msg.sender` and allow the msg.sender to withdraw it himself.
