# Free minting of players when prizeDistributorAddress is a non-existing smart contract as low level-call does not check for contract existence

## Summary

If `_prizeDistributorAddress` in `FootiumAcademy.sol` is a non-existing smart contract the user can mint players for free and the project looses the ETH that otherwise would be required to pay for minting players

The Solidity documentation states the following (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/control-structures.html): "The low-level functions **call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent**, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.

## Vulnerability Detail

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L208 a low level call is made to the `_prizeDistributorAddress` to transfer the user supplied ETH to pay for minting players.

However if `_prizeDistributorAddress` is a non-existing smart contract (due to misconfiguration / missing checks for contract existence) the call will return true and not false which makes the check for successful ETH transfer pass in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L209.

In line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L200 the `AcademyPlayerMinted` events were emitted already (documenting the successful mint for each player) which gets tracked by the Footium backend.

## Impact

The issue will lead to free mints of players for the user.

It will remain unnoticed if there is no off-chain check validating emitted `AcademyPlayerMinted` events against the balance of the assumed correct `_prizeDistributorAddress`.

It will also make on-chain and off-chain accounting differ since off-chain accounting is based on emitted `AcademyPlayerMinted` events and on-chain accouting by looking at the balance of `_prizeDistributorAddress`.

There is no setter function available that could correct the `_prizeDistributorAddress` to a correct address which requires a contract redeployment to fix the issue.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check for contract existence in the `initialize` function of `FootiumAcademy.sol`.

For implementing the check the `isContract` function of OpenZeppelin Address.sol (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L40) can be used.

```Solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";
[...]
require(prizeDistributorAddress.isContract(), "prizeDistributorAddress is not a contract");

```
Please be aware of the limitations of checking for contract existence here: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L15
