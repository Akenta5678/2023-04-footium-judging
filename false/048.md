# ERC20 of Missing Return Values causes tokens to get stuck

## Summary
Some tokens do not return a bool (e.g. `USDT`, `BNB`, `OMG`) on ERC20 methods.
These tokens can be sent to the contract, but cannot be retrieved by the transfer function, resulting in a stack of assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumEscrow`'s `transferERC20` calls `erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount)`.
`FootiumPrizeDistributor`'s `claimERC20Prize` calls `_token.transfer(_to, value)`.
Both use ERC20 transfer and attempt to transfer the token outside of the contract, but an error occurs and the transfer always fails.
## Impact
Tokens stack forever.
