# currentSeasonId can be overridden with numbers (both greater and lesser than current number)

## Summary
currentSeasonId is initialized to 1 in the initialize function, but when the changeCurrentSeasonId() function is called, there is no check implement on the value accepted which could also be 0. 


## Vulnerability Detail
setting currentSeasonId to 0 would conflict with the mintPlayers() function in FootiumAcademy contract. The minting function will fail.
currentSeasonId logic is not clearly evident as to whether it will increase with time or can it also decrease. Enough state management is not implemented.

Example, currentSeason starts at 1, then user incements to 5  and then 7. After that, can it revert back to 0 or 1 or 2. Or should it remain above the last number.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a validation framework to ensure that the currentSeason variable transits to the right state and cannot be set to numbers in any direction including zero while it was initialized with 1. Setting to zero conflicts with the functioning of mintPlayers().
