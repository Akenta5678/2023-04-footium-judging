# FootiumClub is suspicious of the reorg attack

## Summary
The `safeMint` function deploys a quest contract using the create, where the address derivation depends only on the FootiumClub nonce.
At the same time, Arbitrum to which the FootiumClub will be deployed is suspicious of the reorg attack.

Optimistic rollups (Optimism/Arbitrum) are suspect to reorgs since if someone finds a fraud the blocks will be reverted, even though the minter receives a confirmation and already created a FootiumEscrow.

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine that Alice requests admin to mint FootiumClub, and therefore mint FootiumEscrow. 
```solidity
    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
    {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

        _mint(to, tokenId);

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```

And then sends ETH/FootiumToken to her escrow.
Bob sees that the network block reorg happens and requests admin to mint FootiumClub. Thus, it creates FootiumEscrow with an address to which Alice sends funds. Then Alices' transactions are executed and Alice transfers funds to Bob's controlled FootiumEscrow.

## Impact
If users rely on the address derivation in advance, any funds sent to the escrow could potentially be withdrawn by anyone else. All in all, it could lead to the theft of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Deploy the `FootiumEscrow` contract via create2 with salt that includes clubOwnerAddress and tokenId
