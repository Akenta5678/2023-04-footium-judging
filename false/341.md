# MINTER_ROLE can mint arbitrary amount of tokens can cause a serious risk

## Summary
Using the `safeMint()` function of FootiumClub contract to mint a Footium football club tokens, an address with MINTER_ROLE can mint an arbitrary amount of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the private key of an address with the `MINTER_ROLE` is compromised, the attacker will be able to mint an unlimited amount of club tokens.
I think this is unnecessary and poses a serious centralization risk.

Note: I noticed there is no setup or grant role for MINTER_ROLE on constructer but since   `_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);` exist then the contract deployer should be able to grant the MINTER_ROLE later externally.


## Impact
MINTER_ROLE can mint arbitrary amount of Footium football club tokens

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L56-L68

```solidity
    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
    {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;


        _mint(to, tokenId);


        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider adding more restricted roles and remove the MINTER_ROLE, make the Footium football club tokens only mintable by the owner (not sure incase minters need to be given minting rights).
- Restrict the MINTER_ROLE to mint a limited amount of tokens.
