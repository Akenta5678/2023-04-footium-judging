# User is not able to approve Single NFT

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
In the technical document, it states that "This contract is designed to facilitate the transfer of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in and out of the escrow account." Upon examining the implementation of this contract, it includes functions such as ERC20.approve(), ERC20.transfer(), ERC721.setApprovalForAll(), and ERC721.safeTransferFrom() to facilitate transfers. However, the ERC721.approve() function is excluded from the implementation. While ERC721.setApprovalForAll() can be used, it grants permission to all of one's NFTs, which is risky. Therefore, ERC721.approve() should be used to delegate permission for a single NFT. This will enhance the functionality of the escrow contract.

## Impact
Escrow is not able to approve single NFT which degraded functionality of Escrow
