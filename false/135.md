# Owner has too many priveleges and can steal ether from the FootiumAcademy

## Summary

The idea of having a function that executes a transfer of the contract's ether balamce to the address provided by the owner is just a window for the owner to steal ether

## Vulnerability Detail

[FootiumAcademy.withdraw();](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/11736f3f7f7efa88cb99ee98b04b85a46621347c/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L214-L226)

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Transfers contract available ether balance to the contact owner address
     * @dev Only owner address allowed
     */
    function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Owner can steal ether from the `FootiumAcademy` contract which is a severe undermining of decentralization
