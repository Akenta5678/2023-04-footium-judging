# Missing 0-address check of `paymentReceiverAddress` leads to lost ETH

## Summary
Missing 0-address check of `paymentReceiverAddress` leads to lost ETH

## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol`, the function `setPaymentReceiverAddress` is used to set a new `paymentReceiverAddress`. But it doesn't check if the new address is a 0-address. 
As a result of which, when a user calls the `makePayment` function in the same contract to pay ETH for a feature, then due to `paymentReceiverAddress` being 0-address, all the ETH sent (msg.value) will be sent to 0-address, and will be permanently lost.

## Impact
Lose of ETH
