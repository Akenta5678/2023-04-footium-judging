# Club owners can mint players for free when fee was not provided for divisionTier

## Summary 
Club owners can mint players for free when fee was not provided for divisionTier. Can be prevented using trivial check

## Vulnerability Detail
When minting players, a club owner needs to pay a totalFee,[ which is calculated by multiplying the number of players minted by the fee of the divisionTier.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L258). Fees for each divisions [are set during initialization](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L67), but nowhere is it checked that fees for the divisionTier have been set correctly or at all.

## Impact
When minting players, [if divisionTier > fees.length](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L72) or [fees[i] == 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L119), club owners can mint unlimited players for free.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check that the ```divisionToFee[divisionTier] != 0```. This prevents either setting the fee incorrectly, or minting players for a division that is present in the merkle tree, but for which the fee has not been set during initialization.

```contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L253
if (SeasonID.unwrap(seasonId) > currentSeasonId) {
    revert PlayerTooYoung(seasonId);
}

->

if (SeasonID.unwrap(seasonId) > currentSeasonId) {
    revert PlayerTooYoung(seasonId);
}

if (divisionToFee[divisionTier] == 0) {
    revert DivisonFeeCanNotBeZero(divisionTier);
}
```
