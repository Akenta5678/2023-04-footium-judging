# APPROVED USERS CANNOT TRANSFER ON BEHALF OF THE OWNER

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L75

The `FootiumEscrow` uses the `setApprovalForERC721` and `setApprovalForERC20`. These are to facilitate transfer of tokens on behalf of the owner. However, all the transfer/withdrawal functions use the `onlyClubOwner` modifier. This means an approved person cannot perform transfers on-behalf of the owner.
