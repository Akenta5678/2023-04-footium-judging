# Admin privilege - A single point of failure can allow a hacked or malicious owner use critical functions in the project



## Summary

The owner role has a single point of failure and onlyOwner can use critical a few functions.

Even if protocol admins/developers are not malicious there is still a chance for Owner keys to be stolen. In such a case, the attacker can cause serious damage to the project due to important functions. In such a case, users who have invested in project will suffer high financial losses.

## Vulnerability Detail

Below are just a few instances of functions just from `FootiumAcademy.sol`

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Changes the `_maxGenerationId` storage variable.
     * @param maxGenerationId The new value for the `maxGenerationId` storage variable.
     * @dev Only owner address allowed.
     */
    function changeMaxGenerationId(uint256 maxGenerationId) public onlyOwner {
        _maxGenerationId = maxGenerationId;
        emit ChangedMaxGenerationId(_maxGenerationId);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Changes the `_clubDivsMerkleRoot` variable.
     * @param _merkleRoot is the value for the `_clubDivsMerkleRoot` variable.
     * @dev Only owner address allowed.
     */
    function setClubDivsMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {
        _clubDivsMerkleRoot = _merkleRoot;

        emit ChangedClubDivsMerkleRoot(_clubDivsMerkleRoot);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Updates division fees.
     * @param _fees an array of division fees to be set.
     * @dev Only owner address allowed.
     */
    function setDivisionFees(uint256[] memory _fees) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 max = _fees.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < max; ) {
            uint256 fee = _fees[i];
            divisionToFee[i + 1] = fee;

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }

        emit ChangedDivisionFees(_fees);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Changes the `currentSeasonId` storage variable.
     * @param _newSeasonId The new value for the `currentSeasonId` storage variable.
     * @dev Only owner address allowed
     */
    function changeCurrentSeasonId(uint256 _newSeasonId) external onlyOwner {
        currentSeasonId = _newSeasonId;

        emit ChangedCurrentSeasonId(currentSeasonId);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Unpause the contract
     * @dev Only owner address allowed.
     */
    function activateContract() external onlyOwner {
        _unpause();
    }

    /**
     * @notice Pause the contract
     * @dev Only owner address allowed.
     */
    function pauseContract() external onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }
```

Note that the above are just instances within `FootiumAcademy.sol` and other instances exist in other contracts in scope which are covered in `Code Snippet`

## Impact

Hacked owner or malicious owner can immediately use critical functions in the project.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a time lock to critical functions. Admin-only functions that change critical parameters should emit events and have timelocks.
Events allow capturing the changed parameters so that off-chain tools/interfaces can register such changes with timelocks that allow users to evaluate them and consider if they would like to engage/exit based on how they perceive the changes as affecting the trustworthiness of the protocol or profitability of the implemented financial services.

Allow only multi-signature wallets to call the function to reduce the likelihood of an attack.

Note that the status quo regarding significant centralization vectors has always been to award `M severity`, in order to warn users of the protocol of this category of risks. See [here](https://gist.github.com/GalloDaSballo/881e7a45ac14481519fb88f34fdb8837) for list of centralization issues previously judged.
