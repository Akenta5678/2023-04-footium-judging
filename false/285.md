# If owner wallet of FootiumAcademy is lost, game is done

## Summary
The owner wallet of FootiumAcademy can set a new season with the `changeCurrentSeasonId`. If the owner doesn't have access to the wallet anymore, the season can't be set anymore so the game is basically done.
## Vulnerability Detail
Additionally, the currentSeasonId is set to the parameter instead of increased by +1. If the owner makes a mistake and sets the season back to an earlier season, no new players can be minted and the game will be unplayable.
## Impact
Owner wallet has a lot of responsibilites to change the current season so there is more possibility of something going wrong.
## Code Snippet
FootiumAcademy.sol#L135-L139[](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L135-L139)
```solidity
    function changeCurrentSeasonId(uint256 _newSeasonId) external onlyOwner {
        currentSeasonId = _newSeasonId;

        emit ChangedCurrentSeasonId(currentSeasonId);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a time when the season gets automatically updated and always increment the season by 1. This eliminates the need of an owner wallet and also eliminates all the possible human errors.
