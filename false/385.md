# In `FootiumGeneralPaymentContract`, set `footiumClub` contract address to be immutable.

## Summary
The `footiumClub` is never set to a new value but is not made to be `immutable` either.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the contracts are designed to be upgradeable, its important to make sure no changes are made which can break exisiting functionality. 

Make sure below variable is immutable, so it can only be set from constructor/initializer.
```solidity
IFootiumClub public footiumClub;
```

## Impact
footiumClub address could be changed accidentally in future contract upgrades, which is a very common mistake.

## Recommendation

```solidity

```
