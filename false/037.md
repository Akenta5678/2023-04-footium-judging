# call() vulnerable to gas griefing attack from huge data return even though returned data not used

## Summary
Contracts using call() to send ETH unnecessarily expose themselves to gas griefing attacks from huge returned data payload, even though they don't use that returned data.

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimETHPrize() [L168-171](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L168-L171):

```solidity
(bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
if (!sent) {
    revert FailedToSendETH(value);
}
```
Is the same as writing:
```solidity
(bool sent, bytes returned data) = _to.call{value: value}("");
if (!sent) {
    revert FailedToSendETH(value);
}
```

An attacker can return a huge data payload forcing large gas cost to copy it into memory. There's no need to expose yourself to this since the returned data is never used, can be replaced by low-level call (see recommendation).

## Impact
Contracts unnecessarily expose themselves to gas griefing attacks.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use low-level call:
```solidity
bool sent;
assembly {
    sent := call(gas(), to, value, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    // could also limit the gas eg
    //sent := call(10000, to, value, 0, 0, 0, 0)
}
```
