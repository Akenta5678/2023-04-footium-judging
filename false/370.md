# No non-zero number check for `divisionTier` function on `mintPlayers()` in FootiumAcademy contract.

## Summary

It is important to make sure divisionTier is a non-zero number, which is currently missing. The function is missing onlyClubOwner check which is another issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

The values are passed down to function `_validateMintingParams()` and the number is checked with `divisionToFee` mapping where values are always set from 1 and above. Check `setDivisionFees` to confirm.

```solidity
function setDivisionFees(uint256[] memory _fees) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 max = _fees.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < max; ) {
            uint256 fee = _fees[i];
            divisionToFee[i + 1] = fee;
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
        emit ChangedDivisionFees(_fees);
    }
    ```

## Impact

Unnecessary gas cost with verifying MerkleProof which could be avoided by a simple greater than 0 check.
