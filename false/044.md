# VULN 1 

## [GAS] Generate merkle tree offchain
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 56 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

    event ChangedClubDivsMerkleRoot(bytes32 merkleRoot);


Found in line 30 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

    event SetERC20MerkleRoot(bytes32 merkleRoot);


Found in line 31 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

    event SetETHMerkleRoot(bytes32 merkleRoot);

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

Generating merkle tree onchain is expensive, especially when you want to include a large set of values. Consider generating it offchain and publishing the root when creating a new pool.










# VULN 2 

## [GAS] Use != 0 instead of > 0 for unsigned integer comparison
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 134 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol:

        if (balance > 0) {


Found in line 220 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

Found in line 165 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

        if (value > 0) {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

Use != 0 instead of > 0 for unsigned integer comparison.










# VULN 3 

## [GAS] ++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} and ++i costs less gas than i++
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 78 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol:

                i++;


Found in line 123 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

                i++;


Found in line 203 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

                i++;

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in for and while-loops. Moreover ++i costs less gas than i++, especially when its used in for-loops (--i/i-- too).










# VULN 4 

## [GAS] Don’t initialize variables with default value
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 118 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < max; ) {


Found in line 183 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

In such cases, initializing the variables with default values would be unnecessary and can be considered a waste of gas. Additionally, initializing variables with default values can sometimes lead to unnecessary storage operations, which can increase gas costs. For example, if you have a large array of variables, initializing them all with default values can result in a lot of unnecessary storage writes, which can increase the gas costs of your contract.










# VULN 5 

## [GAS] Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 53 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol:

    function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature)


Found in line 40 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumClub.sol:

    function initialize(string memory baseURI) external initializer {


Found in line 115 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

    function setDivisionFees(uint256[] memory _fees) public onlyOwner {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

Mark data types as calldata instead of memory where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically loaded into memory. If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as calldata. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies memory storage.










# VULN 6 

## [GAS] Cache array length outside of loop
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 183 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration. That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).










# VULN 7 

## [GAS] <x> += <y> Costs More Gas Than <x> = <x> + <y> For State Variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 129 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;


Found in line 166 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

            totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

When you use the += operator on a state variable, the EVM has to perform three operations: load the current value of the state variable, add the new value to it, and then store the result back in the state variable. On the other hand, when you use the = operator and then add the values separately, the EVM only needs to perform two operations: load the current value of the state variable and add the new value to it. Better use <x> = <x> + <y> For State Variables.










# VULN 8 

## [GAS] Use hardcode address instead address(this)
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 125 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol:

        erc721Contract.safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, tokenId);


Found in line 133 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol:

        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;


Found in line 62 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumClub.sol:

        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);


Found in line 219 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

Instead of using address(this), it is more gas-efficient to pre-calculate and use the hardcoded address. Foundry’s script.sol and solmate’s LibRlp.sol contracts can help achieve this.










# VULN 9 

## [GAS] Empty blocks should be removed or emit something
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 44 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol:

    receive() external payable {


Found in line 53 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

    receive() external payable {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the contract is meant to be extended, the contract should be abstract and the function signatures be added without any default implementation. If the block is an empty if-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...} => if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}}). Empty receive()/fallback() payable functions that are not used, can be removed to save deployment gas.


# VULN 1 

## [LOW] Keccak Constant values should used to immutable rather than constant
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 24 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumClub.sol:

    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");


Found in line 26 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol:

    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

There is a difference between constant variables and immutable variables, and they should each be used in their appropriate contexts. While it doesn’t save any gas because the compiler knows that developers often make this mistake, it’s still best to use the right tool for the task at hand.










# VULN 2 

## [LOW] Empty receive()/payable fallback() function does not authenticate requests
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 44 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol:

    receive() external payable {


Found in line 53 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

    receive() external payable {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. require(msg.sender == address(weth))). Having no access control on the function means that someone may send Ether to the contract, and have no way to get anything back out, which is a loss of funds. If the concern is having to spend a small amount of gas to check the sender against an immutable address, the code should at least have a function to rescue unused Ether.










# VULN 3 

## [LOW] Use Ownable2Step rather than Ownable
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 7 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumToken.sol:

contract FootiumToken is ERC20Upgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable {


Found in line 12 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol:

contract FootiumClubMinter is OwnableUpgradeable {


Found in line 20 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumClub.sol:

    OwnableUpgradeable


Found in line 22 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol:

    OwnableUpgradeable


Found in line 17 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol:

    OwnableUpgradeable


Found in line 28 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol:

    OwnableUpgradeable


Found in line 22 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

    OwnableUpgradeable

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

Ownable2Step and Ownable2StepUpgradeable prevent the contract ownership from mistakenly being transferred to an address that cannot handle it (e.g. due to a typo in the address), by requiring that the recipient of the owner permissions actively accept via a contract call of its own.










# VULN 4 

## [LOW] Keccak Constant values should used to immutable rather than constant
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 24 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumClub.sol:

    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");


Found in line 26 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol:

    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

By using immutable variables, the Keccak256 hash is computed at contract deployment time rather than at compilation time. This means that the value can be updated if the algorithm changes in a future compiler version, without breaking backward compatibility. Additionally, it provides better gas optimization, as the Keccak256 hash is computed only once at contract deployment instead of every time the variable is accessed during execution.










# VULN 5 

## [LOW] Use .call instead of .transfer to send ether
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 110 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol:

        erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);


Found in line 130 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:

            _token.transfer(_to, value);

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

.transfer will relay 2300 gas and .call will relay all the gas. If the receive/fallback function from the recipient proxy contract has complex logic, using .transfer will fail, causing integration issues.Replace .transfer with .call. Note that the result of .call need to be checked.










# VULN 6 

## [LOW] Use the safe variant and ERC721.mint
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 24 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumToken.sol:

        _mint(receiver, amount);


Found in line 65 at footium-souilos-contest/contracts/FootiumClub.sol:

        _mint(to, tokenId);

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

.mint won’t check if the recipient is able to receive the NFT. If an incorrect address is passed, it will result in a silent failure and loss of asset. OpenZeppelin recommendation is to use the safe variant of _mint. Replace _mint() with _safeMint().
