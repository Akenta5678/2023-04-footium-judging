# Address set to many functions is not validating for address(0x0)

## Summary
Address set in the initializer or subsequent set functions is not validating for address(0x0). The code should be defensive for blockchain and it is advised to implement the address(0x0) validation.

The defense being that values are either set at the time of creation or reset by the owner. But human error cannot be eliminated.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are many occurances and as a defensive implemenation, incase of a address(0x0) the call should revert so that any transfer or minting function does not sent tokens to address(0x0) which can never be recovered.

FootiumAcademy - initialize function could accept address(0x0) for priceDistributorAddress.
FootiumClub.safeMint - address to should also be validated. It applies to interfaces as well.
FootiumClubMinter - setPlayerAddress  & setClubAddress
FootiumEscrow - 
FootiumGeneralPaymentContract - paymentReceiverAddress in constructor and setPaymentReceiverAddress function.
FootiumPlayer - in constructor and in safeMint & setRoyaltyInfo functions

## Impact
Loss of tokens, funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement  a check to verify that the target account is non zero address before entering into the business logic using a require statement
require(inputAddress!=address(0x0),"Zero address is not acceptable");
