# No possibility to approve single Player NFT IDs puts all player NFTs at risk

## Summary
There is no possibility for the club owner to only approve specific player NFT IDs in the escrow account of this club. This puts all the current and future players of the club at risk. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the escrow account, the club owner can only use `setApprovalForERC721` if he wants to e.g., sell a player NFT on a NFT marketplace. This puts all current and future players of the club at risk in case there is an exploit at the NFT marketplace that has approval for all. 

## Impact

If the approvalForAll given to someone is not revoke, all current and future players of the club are at risk of being taken in case the e.g., marketplace that has the approval for all has a vulnerability. This is especially problematic if a club that has given this approval is sold. The new owner does not know that the marketplace has this approval and will therefor not revoke this approval.
