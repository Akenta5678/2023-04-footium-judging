# If prizeClaimer got blacklisted by asset contract, their prize can be permanently frozen with the FootiumPrizeDistributor

## Summary
It's impossible for user to transfer their ERC20Prize to another address. If for some reason user got blacklisted by ERC20Prize token, these funds will be permanently frozen as now there is no mechanics to move them to another address or specify the recipient for the transfer

## Vulnerability Detail
In readme of Footium is mentioned that ERC20 is any, which includes tokens with blacklist like USDC.
If user is authorized via MerkleTree to claim USDC prize, there is a probability that he got blacklisted and can receive this USDC amount. Because funds are transferred to `_to` address which written in MerkleTree
```solidity
    function claimERC20Prize(
        address _to,
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        if (_to != msg.sender) {
            revert InvalidAccount();
        }

        if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                erc20MerkleRoot,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_token, _to, _amount))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidERC20MerkleProof();
        }

        uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];

        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }

        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
    }
```

## Impact
User's funds being permanently frozen in full, but backlisting is a low probability event, so setting the severity to be medium.

## Recommendation
Refactor code to allow authorized user to specify destination address when claim token
```solidity
    function claimERC20Prize(
        address _to,
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        DELETE THIS CHECK
        // if (_to != msg.sender) {
        //     revert InvalidAccount();
        // }

        if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                erc20MerkleRoot,                  // REFACTOR
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_token, msg.sender, _amount))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidERC20MerkleProof();
        }
                                                            // REFACTOR
        uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][msg.sender];

        if (value > 0) {            // REFACTOR
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][msg.sender] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }
                                // REFACTOR
        emit ClaimERC20(_token, msg.sender, value);
    }
```
