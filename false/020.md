# computation of maxSeasonId

## Summary
The computation of maxSeasonId does not seems to make sense. 
The academyMinAge is set to 18 and academyMaxAge is set to 20. 

There are no functions provided to update the academy min and max age.
and maxSeasonId is calcuated as below.

uint256 maxSeasonId = SeasonID.unwrap(seasonId) +
            academyMaxAge -
            academyMinAge;

it could be seasonId + 2.

## Vulnerability Detail
Logic is not making any evident sense, May be more comments should be added to explain the logic. May be it is just the documentation that is missing.

## Impact
Not sure of the logic to verify the functioning

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either there should be functions to update te min and max age of the academy or add documentation to explain the logic of computing maxSeasonId. Once the logic is more description, this may be a non issue.
