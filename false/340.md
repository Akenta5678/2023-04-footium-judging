# Excessive ETH not refunded

## Summary
The protocol does not refund overpayment of ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
When someone tries to mint new Players in the `FootiumAcademy` using the `mintPlayers` function, he should send an amount of ETH. This amount is then verified with the call to the function _validateMintingParams() which only checks if the ETH amount sent by the user is msg.value >= totalFee. Unfortunately, no other code is made in either that function or the mintPlayers function to refund the overpayment of ETH.

## Impact
The protocol does not refund overpayment of ETH. Excessive ETH is not included in the protocols accounting as a result the funds are permanently locked in the protocol (Loss of funds).

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
VSCode
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Options:

refund - in _validateMintingParams, refund tokens back to msg.sender if msg.value > totalFee
revert - change the expression if(msg.value < totalFee) to if(msg.value != totalFee) and revert the transaction
