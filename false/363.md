# Missing modifier (access control) on function `mintPlayers()` in FootiumAcademy contract.

## Summary

The `mint()` function is only meant for the club owners to mint player NFTs but the function seems to be open for all. (As per the diagram in docs - Both ClubMinter and Academy should be able to create mint players)

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```

## Impact

Anyone can call mint any amount of players NFTs.

## Recommendation

Replace lines with following code

function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant onlyOwner {
