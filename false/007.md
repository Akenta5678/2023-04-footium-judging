# Missing function to burn / delete minted players in FootiumAcademy.sol

## Summary
There is no function to burn / delete minted players in FootiumAcademy.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
As the owner goes on creating new players he needs to delete players too because the number of players he has, has an impact on `totalFee`

## Impact
Owner may need to delete some players but he won't be able to.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement a burn / delete function for owner to delete players too. Don't forget to add the `onlyOwner` modifier
