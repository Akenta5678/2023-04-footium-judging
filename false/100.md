# Native tokens could be blocked in escrow contract, if owner is contract without receive function

## Summary
Native tokens could be blocked in escrow contract, if club owner is contract without receive() or fallback payable function.
## Vulnerability Detail
Club owner can not set address for sending native tokens in withdraw function
## Impact
1. User send native token (ARB) to contract FootiumEscrow. Contract accept it because it has receive() external payable function.
2. Owner of club (contract without payable receive function)  want to withdraw ARB from contract and call FootiumEscrow.withdraw() and tx will revert.
```solidity
 function withdraw() external onlyClubOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```
