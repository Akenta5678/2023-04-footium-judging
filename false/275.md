# In `FootiumAcademy`, a club owner may mint 0 players but still have their ETH taken as payment

## Summary
`FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers` accepts ETH as payment for academy player minting.
Due to a missing check on `generationIds` length and the only ETH-related check in `_validateMintingParams` being `msg.value < totalFee`, the user may end up paying for nothing.

## Vulnerability Detail
The for loop in `FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers` reads:
```solidity
        // @audit can be skipped with empty generationIds
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {
...
        }

        // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
```

Further, the only validation on ETH sent is in `FootiumAcademy._validateMintingParams`:
```solidity
        uint256 playerCount = generationIds.length;
        uint256 totalFee = playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier];
        // @audit nothing prevents there from being too much ETH & no refund
        if (msg.value < totalFee) {
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
        }
```

These allow a user to call this function with empty `generationIds`, in which case all ETH is stored directly in the `FootiumAcademy` contract.

However, even in the normal case where there are > 0 valid academy players being minted, the contract consumes all of the ETH that is sent to it even if it is an amount above the `totalFee` required.

## Impact
User overpays for mint (potentially minting 0 academy players) with no refund.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A few recommendations:
- Change the validation in `_validateMintingParams` to require `(msg.value == totalFee)` or at least that `msg.value` is within a band of tolerance over `totalFee`.
- Refund the user the excess ETH value `(msg.value - totalFee)` at the end of `mintPlayers`.
- Add input validation to require `generationIds.length >= 0` to prevent users from attempting to mint 0 players.
