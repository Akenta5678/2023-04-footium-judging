# Loss of paid ETH for user in feature payment if message identifying the feature is empty

## Summary

The user can pay for features via the `makePayment` function in `FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol`. If the call does not supply a valid `_message` parameter the ETH is paid but it is not tracked which feaure was paid for.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `makePayment` function in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L84 receives a `_message` parameter to identify the feature to pay for (e.g. stadium:medium:brick:north).

But no validation exists to enforce `_message`to be set and not being empty.

If the fontend sends an empty value the user looses his ETH but the feature payment is not tracked poperly for off-chain processing and feature activation via the emitted `PaymentMade` event in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L103.

Relying on frontend validation for `_message` to be set to a proper value is not sufficient espcially in the context of payments. It should be enforced in the contract as well to prevent loss of funds for the user.

## Impact

User can loose submitted ETH without having his feature payment tracked properly.

## Recommendation

Add a check to the makePayment function in `FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol` to validate that `_message` has a proper value and revert if not. A minimal check would be to check for the length of `_message`.

```Solidity
uint256 messageLength = bytes(_message).length;
require(messageLength != 0, "No message provided");
```
