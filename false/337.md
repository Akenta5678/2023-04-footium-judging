# Risk with ERC20 not implementing EIP20

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard especially for transfer/transferFrom function  (like USDT) which return void instead of a successful boolean.
As the protocol indicates wanting to be able to use any ERC20 token, this could be a critical element for the game even if it doesn't directly impact the protocol (since to date this functions seems to be called ourtside the protocol)

## Impact
Tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20  could lead to unexpected behavior in the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommanded to use SafeERC20 from OpenZeppelinâ€™s for transfer, transferFrom and appove functions
