# No way to approve specific ERC721 Tokens from Escrow

## Summary

It is only possible to approve all ERC721 Tokens in the Escrow (e.g. Players) instead of specific ones. This can cause issues when only wanting to grant access to single NFTs

## Vulnerability Detail

the `setApprovalForERC721` only allows the user to approve all NFTs of a collection (e.g. all Footium Players).

## Impact

E.g. a malicious or exploitable marketplace could steal all NFTs of the collection instead only one, when the user is listing it.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L90-L96

```solidity
 function setApprovalForERC721(
        IERC721 erc721Contract,
        address to,
        bool approved
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(to, approved);
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be an option to approve only specific tokenIds of a collection.
