# Solidity versions should be fixed in contratcs

## Summary
It is advised to avoid floating pragma in contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested the most with. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs.

## Impact
Potential security issues due to compiler updates
