# `claimERC20Prize` and `claimETHPrize` are vulnerable to cross-chain-replay attacks

## Summary
The function `claimETHPrize` and `claimERC20Prize` are vulnerable to cross-chain-replay attacks

## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` , the function `claimETHPrize` and `claimERC20Prize` are used for distributing tokens or ETH to the winners. The functions uses Merkle proofs to check if the `msg.sender` is on winners list. In order to claim the prize, they need to submit a valid Merkle proof
But, if there's a fork or Footium contracts are deployed on other chains, then it is likely that an attacker could replay the same Merkle proof used above, to claim prize on that other chain.

## Impact
An attacker could replay the Merkle proof on other blockchain, to claim prize , even if he didn't win the season on the other chain.
