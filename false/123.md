# Missing events for critical parameter changing operations by owner

## Summary

The owner of FootiumClubMinter.sol contract, who is potentially trusted as per specification (though this can change anytime) can change the market critical parameters such as the addresses of the Club/Player/baseURI/ etc, though some other critical variables emit an event once set the aforementioned do not

## Vulnerability Detail

2- [CodeArena contest for tracer](https://code4rena.com/contests/2021-06-tracer-contest)

## Impact

Owner changes the critical addresses or values that significantly change the security posture/perception of the protocol. No events are emitted and users lose funds/confidence. The protocol takes a reputation hit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider emitting events when these addresses/values are updated. This will be more transparent and it will make it easier to keep track of the status of the system.
