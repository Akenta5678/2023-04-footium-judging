# Club owner could not receive prize(native tokens), if owner is contract without receive function

## Summary
Club owner could not receive prize, if owner is contract without receive function
## Vulnerability Detail
Club owner could not receive prize in native tokens(ARB), if owner is contract without receive() payable function, because tx will revert
## Impact
1. Footium team call FootiumPrizeDistributor.setETHMerkleRoot() with root, which have information, that Alice(owner of club id 
  5, for example, has prize 1 ARB).
2. But Alice could not get prize, because Alice is contract, which dont have payable receive function. And function has check
```solidity
 if (_to != msg.sender) {
            revert InvalidAccount();
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Delete check _to == msg.sender and change keccak data
```solidity
// before
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_token, _to, _amount))
// change to 
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_token, msg.sender, _amount))
```
