# FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol : making external call without specifying the gas limit would result in loss of ETH stored inside the contract

## Summary

`FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` contract makes the external call while calling the [claimETHPrize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#LL144C14-L144C27)

During external call, it sends certain amount of eth to the `_to` address.  When we look at the calling place, there is no gas limit specified.

Since the contract stores the ETH, for any gas expenditure, it has to pay from its pocket.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract has the ETH inside it. Also, it has the receive function to receive the eth

    receive() external payable {
        emit ETHReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

[claimETHPrize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L144C14-L176) is called by user to claim the ETH.

    function claimETHPrize(
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        if (_to != msg.sender) {
            revert InvalidAccount();
        }


        if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                ethMerkleRoot,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_to, _amount))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidETHMerkleProof();
        }


        uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];


        if (value > 0) {
            totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;


            (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(value);
            }
        }


        emit ClaimETH(_to, value);
    }
}

here, it makes the external call,

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L165C25-L172

in the external call, the receiver address either can be a contract or EOA.

if `to` address is contract address, it can be malicious and have some code in it before returning to calling contract.

For any operation that is performed inside the external contract, the caller have to pay the fee for that.

In this case, caller is `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contract.

## Impact

Loss of ETH in the form of gas.

## Recommendation

Specify the gas limit while making the external call.
