# The club owner can mint players without pay fees if the division tier fee is not configured

## Summary

It is possible to mint players without pay fees if the division tier does not have fees configured.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [FootiumAcademy.setDivisionFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#LL115C14-L115C29) helps to configure the division tier fee. Also the [FootiumAcademy.setClubDivsMerkleRoot()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#LL104C14-L104C35) helps to set the `division merkle root` by the owner.

If a new division tier is added to the merkle root via `FootiumAcademy.setClubDivsMerkleRoot()`, the malicious club owner can [mint players](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166) to that division tier without pay any fees before the owner can set fees to the new division tier via `FootiumAcademy.setDivisionFees()`.

Please see the next situation:

1. Owner adds a new division tier via `FootiumAcademy.setClubDivsMerkleRoot()`.
2. The malicious club owner see the transaction and after the `setClubDivsMerkleRoot()` execution, executes the [mintPlayers()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166) function. So the club owner does not pay fees for the minted players.
3. The owner calls `setDivisionFees()` in order to set the fee to the new division tier.

## Impact

The club owner will not pay fees when new divisions are added to the merkle root and the division tier fee is not configured. Club owner can mint players for free.

I created a test where the divisionTier 10 fee is not configured causing that the club owner does not pay fees to the division tier 10. Test steps:

1. Create the divProof 10 division tier.
2. The division tier fee is only configured until the division tier 8. See `divFeesMetadata.json`
3. The club owner mint players to the divisionTier 10 with zero fee cost because there are not fee configured to the division tier 10.
4. The distributor get zero fees so the club owner mint players for free.

## Recommendation

When a new division tier merkle root is added, configure the new division tier fees in the same transaction.
