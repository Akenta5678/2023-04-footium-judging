# FootiumAcademy does not return excess of Ether

## Summary

Club owners need to pay eth on fees when calling `mintPlayers` on the `FootiumAcademy` contract, but if it happens to be a eth surplus this wont be refunded.

## Vulnerability Detail

Scenarios where it could be a surplus of eth when calling `mintPlayer`:

1.- Club owner sent more eth by mistake.
2.- Club owner sent the correct eth amount, but an owner transaction to reduce fees happen to reach the arbitrum sequencer first and then executed before club owner tx.
 
## Impact

Club owners will lose any surplus of eth sent when calling `mintPlayers`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Refund the difference of `msg.value - totalFee` when `msg.value > totalFee`.
