# Some ERC20 tokens do not allow for approval if an existing approval is already in place

## Summary
When changing the allowance for certain tokens, it is necessary to set the allowance to zero before granting a new approval. This is true for tokens like `USDT`, which expect to have zero allowances before approving non-`uint256.max` amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (e.g. `USDT`, `KNC`) do not allow approving an amount `M > 0` when an existing amount `N > 0` is already approved. This is to protect from an `ERC20` attack vector described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#heading=h.b32yfk54vyg9).

## Impact
The issue results in a DoS attack when using the `USDT` token, which is commonly used. However, since this is a special case, the appropriate severity level would be medium.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set the allowance to `0` before increasing the allowance or use `safeApprove`/`safeIncreaseAllowance` .
