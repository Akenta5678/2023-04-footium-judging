# Ownable & AccessControl

## Summary
In ```FootiumPlayer``` , ```AccessControlUpgradeable```  and ```OwnableUpgradeable``` are utilized to control function calls. However, Ownable was not need since access control already grants the deployer the role in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L50


## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
In scenarios where the ```owner``` is changed through ```OwnableUpgradeable``` , the deployer address could still access some admin privileges such as granting the MINTER ROLE at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L61-L71
## Code Snippet


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L5-L6

In the initialize function, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L37-L50

```msg.sender``` is set to   ```owner```  through ```__Ownable_init()``` and  ```DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE``` through ```_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using a singular access control method throughout a contract, and if possible throughout the code base.
