# Userâ€™s may accidentally overpay for some functions and the excess fund is not returned to user

## Summary

The excess fund paid by the user while minting academy player and for future features is not returned to them.

## Vulnerability Detail

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L259
    Clubowner or Footium Players might pay high fee than required while minting the academy player. As there is no withdrawal function for extra fee sent by the user. The extra fee paid by the user goes to prize distributor contract rather than being returned to user.

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L84
  Also in the Footium General Payment Contract, any excess fund sent by the user goes directly to the Payment receiver address.

## Impact

Excess fund paid by the user is not returned to them and it is loss for the user
