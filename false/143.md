# Club owners don't get a refund for the extra amount paid after covering the totalFee to mint players and will be lost forever

## Summary
The club owners don't get a refund for the extra amount paid after covering the fees to mint new players,  nor credited to an internal accounting mechanism to allow the club owner to pull the funds back later.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function mintPlayers() [only sends the fees to the prizeDistributor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L207-L211), but **it doesn't calculate if there is any remaining ETH that should be refunded back to the club owner (The caller)**

- **Even though there is a [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L132-L140) function on the contract, such a function only sends ETH to the owner of this contract., it doesn't return the extra ETH paid to the sender (A club owner)**

## Impact
Club owners can lose the excess ETH they send to the contract to mint new players.
If the total fee to mint new players is `0.8ETH` and the owner sent `1ETH`, it is not getting back the extra amount and will be lost forever.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

- The recommendation is to implement an internal accounting mechanism that will credit the club owners all the extra paid ETH after paying the fees to ming the new players, and also create a new function to allow club owners to pull their extra ETH whenever they want to.

1.- Create a new mapping for the accounting mechanism
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) refundTH;
```
2.- At the end of the [mintPlayers()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166-L212) function, calculate if there was any remaining ETH, if so, update the refundETH mapping
```solidity
    function mintPlayers(
       ...
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {

        ...

        // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
        }

+       uint256 extraETH = (msg.value - totalFee);
+       if (extraETH  != 0) {
+           refundETH[msg.sender] += extraETH ;
+       }
    }
```
3.- Create a new function to allow club owners to pull their extra ETH from this contract
```solidity
function getBackExtraPaidETH() external {
    uint extraETH = refundETH[msg.sender];
    if (extraETH != 0) {
        refundETH[msg.sender] = 0;
        (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: extraETH}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(extraETH);
        }
    } 
}
```
