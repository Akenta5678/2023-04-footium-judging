# The protocol did not return the ETH back to user

## Summary
The protocol did not return the remaining ETH to user, user will lose their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers()` function is used to mint Footium players given certain parameters.After all players have been minted, the function forwards the total fee to the prize distributor contract by calling its call function with the value parameter set to the total fee. However, if msg.value is greater than total fee,The remaining ETH was not returned to the user and remained in the contract.
```solidity
function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint256 totalFee = _validateMintingParams(
            seasonId,
            clubId,
            divisionTier,
            generationIds,
            divisionProof
        );

        uint256 generationId;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {
            generationId = generationIds[i];

            if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
                revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
            }

            if (redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]) {
                revert PlayerAlreadyRedeemed(generationId);
            }

            redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId] = true;

            uint256 playerId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
                _footiumClub.clubToEscrow(clubId)
            );

            emit AcademyPlayerMinted(seasonId, clubId, generationId, playerId);

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }

        // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
        }
    }
