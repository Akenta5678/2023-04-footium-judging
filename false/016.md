# Allowing unlimited minting of Footium Football Clubs and tokens

## Summary
Allowing unlimited minting of Footium Football Clubs and tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the coingecko page, the footium total supply should be 3,015 unique NFTs in the Footium Football Clubs collection and 1,243 unique addresses that are holding the FFC NFT.

However, the `mint()` from FootiumClubMinter.sol and `mint()` from FootiumToken.sol are allowed contract owner unlimited miniting. 

The contract owner can call the mint() function multiple times, and each time she does, it will create a new footiumClub NFT and mint 20 associated footiumPlayer NFTs. 
It just means that while the contract owner cannot mint an unlimited number of footiumPlayer NFTs in a single call, the contract owner can still create multiple footiumClub NFTs and their associated footiumPlayer NFTs by calling the mint() function repeated

## Impact
Allowing unlimited minting of NFTs could lead to inflation of the token supply and potentially devalue the existing tokens

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a maximum cap on the number of NFTs/Tokens that can be minted
e.g `require(totalMinted < MAX_NFT_SUPPLY, "Maximum NFT supply reached");`
