# If the claimer rewards address got blacklisted by the ERC20 token contract it won't be able to claim their rewards

## Summary
It's impossible for a claimer to transfer their rewards to another address. If for some reason the claimer got blacklisted by the ERC20 contract, these rewards funds will be permanently frozen as now there is no mechanics to move them to another address or specify the recipient for the transfer.

There are a number of widely used ERC20 tokens that have blacklists (e.g. USDC, USDT). [Reference](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#tokens-with-blocklists)

## Vulnerability Detail
If the address of a rewarded user got blacklisted by the ERC20 reward token, let's say it is USDC, there is no way to retrieve the rewards. These rewards funds will be permanently locked at the FootirumPrizeDistributor contract

## Impact
rewards funds will be permanently frozen in the the FootirumPrizeDistributor contract

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L106-L134

- The rewards can only be sent to the [caller address (`to` parameter)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L129), if such an address is blacklisted by the ERC20 contract used to distribute rewards, those reward funds will be frozen on the contract causing the awarded user to not be able to pull their rewards


```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(
    address _to,
    IERC20Upgradeable _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    if (_to != msg.sender) {
        revert InvalidAccount();
    }

    ...

    if (value > 0) {
        totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
        _token.transfer(_to, value);
    }

    emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
}

```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the `recipient` argument to the claimERC20Prize() function, so the msg.sender can specify what address should receive the rewards, for example
```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(
    address _to,
+   address _recipient,
    IERC20Upgradeable _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof,
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    if (_to != msg.sender) {
        revert InvalidAccount();
    }

    ...

    if (value > 0) {
        totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
-       _token.transfer(_to, value);
+       _token.transfer(_recipient, value);
    }

    emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
}
```
