# Missing payable for the `_to` parameter

## Summary
Missing payable for the `_to` parameter

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimETHPrize()` function is used to allow an address to claim an ETH reward. However, the `_to` parameter is missing the payable modifier.
If _to is not payable, calling _to.call{value: value}("") will result in a compilation error because it is not possible to send ETH to a non-payable address. The compiler will throw an error indicating that _to must be payable.

If _to is forcibly cast to payable, it will result in an exception at runtime and cause the entire transaction to fail. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that _to is a valid payable address, otherwise the transfer of ETH will fail and the transaction will be rolled back.

## Impact
The transaction may fail.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the payable modifier
```solidity
  function claimETHPrize(
        address payable _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {

```
