# Scope for reentrancy in `withdraw()` function of `FootiumAcademy` and `FootiumEscrow`

## Summary
Lack of `nonReentrant` in withdraw functions makes it possible for attackers to break functionality using attack contracts.

Also one other is that function completes the execution and never reverts even if the user's withdrawable balance is 0. This makes it consume gas for no specific reason.

## Vulnerability Detail
One other issue of `withdraw()` function is that it completes the execution and never reverts even if the user's withdrawable balance is 0. This makes it consume gas for no specific reason.

Consider the function:

```solidity
function withdraw() external onlyClubOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```

Here, the function completes execution even if balance is 0.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding `nonReentrant` or `ReentrancyGuard` to make it robust, and add following line to revert if user balance is 0 :

```solidity
require(balance > 0, "Not enough balance")
```
