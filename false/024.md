# FootiumAcademy contract 's setDivisionFees() function could result in dirty data resulting in incorrect fee computation

## Summary
Footium Academy has a mapping of divisionToFee.
First, it is not clear as to what the tiers are, a better documentation will help.

In addition, the implementation could lead to dirty data.
mapping(uint256 => uint256) public divisionToFee;

Example:
divisionToFee = has 5 elements:
                  divisionToFee[1] = 2;
                  divisionToFee[2] = 3;
                  divisionToFee[3] = 4;
                  divisionToFee[4] = 5;
                  divisionToFee[5] = 6;

Lets say, now owner calls setDivisionFees() with an array values as [5,6,7], which means, the array will be updated as 
                  **divisionToFee[1] = 5;
                  divisionToFee[2] = 6;
                  divisionToFee[3] = 7;**
                  divisionToFee[4] = 5;
                  divisionToFee[5] = 6;

Since the implementation logic assumes that a complete set will be passed, there has to be a check on the array length passed to be greater than equal to mapping valid length. 

Ideally, the logic should delete all the elements in the mapping and reinitialise values with the new array.
But, note, deletion of a tier already mapped in the merkleProof could cause issues in minting function during validation for minting.

## Vulnerability Detail
divisionToFee may have entites in the mapping otherwise not expected by the owner.

## Impact
This could result in incorrect fee computation,  failure to mint players.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Overall, the design for divisionToFee should be revisited as it will implicate the minting function.
Recommendation is decide on the max tiers applicable and initialize all tiers.

and while updating, specify the tier and update the one relevant, one at a time.

check for the index passes to be with in the valid range after account the fact that divisionToFee[0] is invalid as it is never initialized.
