# FootiumEscrow#setApprovalForERC20 Did Not Approve To Zero First

## Summary

Allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

```solidity
File: FootiumEscrow.sol
75:     function setApprovalForERC20(
76:         IERC20 erc20Contract,
77:         address to,
78:         uint256 amount
79:     ) external onlyClubOwner {
80:         erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
81:     }
```

## Impact

All subsequent swaps for the affected token to the same spender will revert

## Recommendation
