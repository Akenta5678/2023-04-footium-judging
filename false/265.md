# Lack of access control on the makePayment function

## Summary

The `makePayment` function in FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol allows any user to make a payment for any club without proper access control.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `makePayment` function allows any address to make a payment for any club. This could lead to unauthorized users paying on behalf of a club or causing disruptions in the payment process.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to make payments for clubs they do not own, resulting in potential loss of funds or disruptions in the payment process.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add access control to the `makePayment` function to ensure that only authorized users can make payments on behalf of their clubs. This can be achieved by implementing a modifier that checks if the caller of the function is the owner of the club.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy the FootiumClub.sol contract and mint a club token with a specific clubId.
2. Deploy the FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol contract and set the FootiumClub contract address.
3. Call the `makePayment` function from an unauthorized address with the clubId and a message.
4. The transaction will go through without any error, and the unauthorized user can make a payment on behalf of the club.
