# EXCESS ETHER NOT REFUNDED IN THE `mintPlayers()` FUNCTION

## Summary
The `mintPlayers` function of the FootiumAcademy.sol contract is a payable function that accepts `totalFee` ETH amount. The logic in the`mintPlayers` function does not refund excess Ether sent along with the transaction making the users lose excess ETH to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is import to refund excess Ether sent to a function so that users don't lose excess Ether to the smart contract. The `mintPlayers` function does not refund excess Ether sent to the smart contract.

1. When a user sends 10 Ether along with the `mintPlayer()` function call.
2. And the `totalFee` is for example 9 ETher.
3. Excess Ether is not refunded to the user and user loses 1 Ether.

```solidity
function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint256 totalFee = _validateMintingParams(
            seasonId,
            clubId,
            divisionTier,
            generationIds,
            divisionProof
        );

        uint256 generationId;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {
            generationId = generationIds[i];

            if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
                revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
            }

            if (redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]) {
                revert PlayerAlreadyRedeemed(generationId);
            }

            redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId] = true;

            uint256 playerId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
                _footiumClub.clubToEscrow(clubId)
            );

            emit AcademyPlayerMinted(seasonId, clubId, generationId, playerId);

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }

        // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
        }
    }

```
## Impact
Excess Ether greater than the `totalFee` amount is lost to the FootiumAcademy.sol contract by the user.

## Recommendation
Consider adding the logic to refund excess ETH to the user like below.
```diff

208: (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
+      uint etherLeft = msg.value - totalFee;
+      (bool ok ) = msg.sender.call{value: etherLeft}(""):
+      if(!ok) revert();
```
