# Loss of Excess ETH Sent to FootiumAcademy's mintPlayers() Function

## Summary

If users sending more ETH than required to the mintPlayers() function will not receive their excess ETH back. Instead, the excess ETH remains in the contract's balance. result in users losing their ETH unintentionally.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the FootiumAcademy#mintPlayers() function, the contract checks if the sent ETH (msg.value) is greater than or equal to the required total fee (totalFee). However, it does not handle the case where the user sends more ETH than the required total fee. The excess ETH is stored in the contract's balance and can be withdrawn by the contract owner using the withdraw() function.

## Impact

Users who accidentally send more ETH than the required total fee might lose their excess ETH. which result loss of excess eth amount for user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this , add a code that returns the excess ETH to the sender after forwarding the required totalFee to the _prizeDistributorAddress. Here's an example of how to do this:

```solidity
// forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
(bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
if (!sent) {
    revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
}

// Return remaining ETH to the sender
uint256 remainingEth = msg.value - totalFee;
if (remainingEth > 0) {
    (bool returned, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: remainingEth}("");
    if (!returned) {
        revert FailedToSendETH(remainingEth);
    }
}
```
