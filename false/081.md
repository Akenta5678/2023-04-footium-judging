# ERC721 approval shouldn't necessarily be for all ERC721 tokens

## Summary
When approving spending of ERC721, club owner shouldn't be forced to approve spending of all ERC721s 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function setApprovalForERC721(
        IERC721 erc721Contract,
        address to,
        bool approved
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(to, approved);
    }
```
The only way to approve spending of ERC721 is allowing a user to spend evert ERC721 that is in the escrow contract. This heavily limits usability and opens numerous attack vectors. For example even if a Alice willingly allows Bob to spend all of the NFTs, upon Alice depositing more NFTs in the escrow contract, Bob will be able to take them all. 
The same way the contract allows for a user to send a particular ERC721, it should allow the user to give allowance for a particular ERC721
```solidity
    function transferERC721(
        IERC721 erc721Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc721Contract.safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, tokenId);
    }
```

## Impact
Giving a person more allowance that what is needed, opening up numerous attack vectors

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add new `ERC721.allow` method which sets allowance for particular ERC721s, rather than all from a certain collection.
