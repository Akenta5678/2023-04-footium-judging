# Extra Ether sent when minting academy players is not returned to the minter

## Summary

It is common practive to return any excess of Ether that a user sends when performing operations that require some calculation.

In this case the `mintPlayers()` accepts extra Ether to mint players, but doesn't return the excess.

## Vulnerability Detail

`mintPlayers()` accepts Ether for minting the academy players:

```solidity
    function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```

But it only checks that the user sent more than the expected fees in `_validateMintingParams()`:

```solidity
    if (msg.value < totalFee) {
        revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
    }
```

It lacks any other validation to prevent sending extra Ether, or any mechanism to return it.

## Impact

Extra Ether sent is not returned to the user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Verify that the user sends the exact amount of Ether required for the minting, or calculate the excess and return it to the user.
