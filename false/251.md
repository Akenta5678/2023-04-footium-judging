# Club owners could mistakenly overpaid to get new features and don't get a refund for the extra amount paid

## Summary
In the `makePayment()#FootiumGeneralPaymentContract` there is no mechanism to calculate if a club owner is overpaying for a feature, and if it does, there is no way the owner can get back the difference between how much it costs the feature and how much it sends to pay for it.

## Vulnerability Detail
If an owner mistakenly sends more ETH than what it costs a feature, the owner won't get the difference back, thus, losing the extra paid ETH forever.

## Impact
Club owners can end up paying more for what a feature really costs and never getting the extra paid amount back.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There could be a couple of things that can be done to prevent this from happening, or at least reducing the total amount of funds that could be lost.

- Easy & Quick temporary remediation might be to set a hard cap limit on the maximum amount of ETH a club owner can send to the `makePayment()`, such a limit can be a variable that is updated by the contract's owner and its value could be the cost of the most expensive feature. If at some points it is released a more expensive feature, the owner can update the value of this limit to match the cost of the new most expensive feature
  - This approach doesn't fix the problem, but it limits the risk exposure.

- A more elaborate and potentially permanent fix could be to create a mechanism to register the available features and its cost, then the owners pick up the feature they want to pay for, the function calculates the difference of how much the owner sends and how much the feature costs and returns back the spare ETH to the owner (Consider to implement a push-pull pattern for this, that means, creating an internal account mechanism to credit the spare ETH to the owners so they can pull their funds at their convenience)
  - This approach fixes the issue at the root and prevents owners from losing a single penny when paying for new features
