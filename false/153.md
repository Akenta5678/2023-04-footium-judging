# Did not approve to zero first

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens like USDT require resetting the approval to 0 first before being able to set it to another value.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example, Tether (USDT)'s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

The vulnerable function is `setApprovalForERC20` in FootiumEscrow.sol
```solidity
    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
``` 
## Impact
The function won't work and will revert for USDT if there was a previous non-zero allowance given.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance.
