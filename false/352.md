# Funds can get stuck in FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumPrizeDistributor contract is lack of withdraw function that can lead to funds being locked.
FootiumPrizeDistributor can obtain funds in a couple of ways::
1.  `totalFee` from FootiumAcademy are transferred to FootiumPrizeDistributor
```solidity
(bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
```
2. Via makePayment() function in FootiumGeneralPaymentContract where  _paymentReceiverAddress the address of the Footium Prize Distributor
```solidity
(bool sent, ) = paymentReceiverAddress.call{value: msg.value}("");
```
3. By direct transfer

Funds can get stuck when new merkleroot was set or user doesn't claimed his rewards see the following issue: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-Phantasmagoria13/issues/8
