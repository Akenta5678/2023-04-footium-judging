# OwnableUpgradeable uses single-step ownership transfer

## Summary

All contracts have OwnableUpgradeable, which can possibly brick the contract. Single-step ownership transfer is not recommended.

Likelihood: Low, because it requires an error on the admin side
Impact: High, because important protocol functionality will be bricked

## Vulnerability Detail

Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever. The ownership pattern implementation for the protocol is in OwnableUpgradeable.sol where a single-step transfer is implemented.This can be a problem for all methods marked in onlyOwner throughout the protocol, some of which are core protocol functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is a best practice to use two-step ownership transfer pattern, meaning ownership transfer gets to a "pending" state and the new owner should claim his new rights, otherwise the old owner still has control of the contract. Consider using OpenZeppelin's Ownable2Step contract.
