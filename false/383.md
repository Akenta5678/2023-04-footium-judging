# No check if NFT having same tokenId was already minted

## Summary
Missing check for checking `tokenId` on `safeMint` in `FootiumClub` contract. Same goes for function in `FootiumPlayer` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
    {
```

## Impact

The function will try to re-mint the NFT which is already minted resulting in unnecessaty gas cost.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep track of used tokenIds using mapping, and avoid accepting duplicate inputs.
