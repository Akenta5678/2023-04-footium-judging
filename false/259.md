# Lack of validation (access control), which lead to unexpected-situation that anyone can call the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()` and mint players freely

## Summary
Within the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()`, there is no validation to check whether or not the caller would be the owner. 
This lead to unexpected-situation that anyone can call the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()` and mint players freely. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()`, players would be minted like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L157-L212
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Mint players corresponding to `generationIds` from the `seasonId` cohort.
     * @param seasonId The season cohort to mint players from.
     * @param clubId The ID of the club to receive the players.
     * @param divisionTier The tier of the division.
     * @param generationIds The unique identifier of each player within the season cohort.
     * @param divisionProof Sibling hashes on the branch from the leaf to the division root of the merkel tree.
     * @dev Only the owner can mint players to their club.  /// @audit
     */
    function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {   /// @audit
        uint256 totalFee = _validateMintingParams( 
            seasonId,
            clubId,
            divisionTier,
            generationIds,
            divisionProof
        );

        uint256 generationId;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {
            generationId = generationIds[i];

            if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
                revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
            }

            if (redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]) {
                revert PlayerAlreadyRedeemed(generationId);
            }

            redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId] = true;

            uint256 playerId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
                _footiumClub.clubToEscrow(clubId)
            );

            emit AcademyPlayerMinted(seasonId, clubId, generationId, playerId);

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
```

According to the [NatSpec](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L164) of the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()` above, the caller must be the owner like this:
> _@dev Only the owner can mint players to their club._

However, there is no validation to check whether or not the caller would be the owner. 

## Impact
This lead to unexpected-situation that anyone can call the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()` and mint players freely.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the `onlyOwner` modifier to the FootiumAcademy#`mintPlayers()` like this:
```solidity
    function mintPlayers(
        SeasonID seasonId,
        uint256 clubId,
        uint256 divisionTier,
        uint256[] calldata generationIds,
        bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
+   ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant onlyOwner {
-   ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        ...
```
