# Loss of contract ownership or owner PK will result in loss of funds

## Summary

Funds can be locked in FootiumPrizeDistributor indefinetly if access to the owner account is lost or inadvertantly changed to an invalid address.

## Vulnerability Detail

FootiumPrizeDistributor is the contract that paid fees from FootiumGeneralPaymentContract are sent to. Over time, it can be expected to hold a signficant value, dependent on the success of the protocol.

In order for any funds to be removed from FootiumPrizeDistributor, a new merkle root must be set by the contract owner using the function at [L79-95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#LL79C5-L95C6). This root must be set on a cycle consistent with Footium's prize cycle - meaning only a certain amount of funds will be eligible for withdrawal after each merkle root is set.

Loss of access to the two merkle root setter functions (setERC20MerkleRoot, setETHMerkleRoot) 

If one of the two following scenario's were to occur, all funds in the FootiumPrizeDistributor not already allocated to be withdrawn by a user, would be lost indefinetly:

Footium Protocol Team loses access to the address identified as the contract owner.
Footium Protocol Team inadvertantly transfers ownership of the contract to an incorrect address.
Neither of the scenarios have an exceptionally high likelihood of occuring, however there is a reasonable chance they could occur. In particular, because FootiumPrizeDistributor uses OpenZeppelin's Ownable, and not Ownable2Step, the risk of inadvertantly transfering ownership of the contract to the incorrect address is increased.

## Impact

All accumulated tokens (ERC-20 and Ether) in the FootiumPrizeDistributor that have not been allocated for withdrawal will be locked in the contract indefinitely.

## Code Snippet

(In particular, if access two these setter functions are lost, additional funds cannot be removed)

```solidity
function setERC20MerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {
        erc20MerkleRoot = _merkleRoot;

        emit SetERC20MerkleRoot(erc20MerkleRoot);
}

...

function setETHMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {
        ethMerkleRoot = _merkleRoot;

        emit SetETHMerkleRoot(ethMerkleRoot);
}
 ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the use of OwnableUpgradeable and replace with Ownable2StepUpgradeable.
Ensure that contract ownership is transferred to a multi-signature contract upon deployment.
