# Avoid hardcoding age limits in `FootiumAcademy` contract

## Summary
It looks like the `academyMinAge` and `academyMaxAge` in the `FootiumAcademy` contract shouldn't be hardcoded. 

## Vulnerability Detail
All initial parameters in the `initialize` function could be modified except `academyMinAge` and `academyMaxAge`. These two are initialized without the opportunity to change them. If nevertheless these parameters should not be changed, they should be declared as constants.

## Impact
It is not possible to change the `academyMinAge` and `academyMaxAge` parameters in the future.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add setter functions for these variables or mark them as constants.
