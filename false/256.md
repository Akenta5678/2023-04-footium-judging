# The surplus fee amount is not returned to the club owner in the `FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers()` function

## Summary

The club owner can send more fee than the necessary but the surplus fee is not returned to the club owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166) helps to create players with a certain amount fee. 

The problem is that the contract [accepts more msg.value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L259) than the necessary amount.

```solidity
File: FootiumAcademy.sol
259:         if (msg.value < totalFee) {
260:             revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
261:         }
```

## Impact

The club owner may lose the surplus fee amount sent to the `FootiumAcademy` contract because there are not any function that helps to calculate the fees, so the club owner may calculate wrongly the needed fees.

I created a test where the surplus amount sent by the club owner stays in the `FootiumAcademy` contract instead of returning back to the club owner. Test steps:

1. Send to the `FootiumAcademy` more fee ethAmount than the necessary. 1.19 amount.
2. Assert the balance in the distributor is 0.56 which is the fee calculation
3. Assert the balance in the `FootiumAcademy` contract is positive which means the club owner does not get back his excedent fee.

```javascript
File: FootiumAcademy.test.ts
344:         it("the surplus fee is not returned", async () => {
345:             // The club Owner send more fee than the necessary but the surplus fee is not returned to the clubOwner
346:             //
347:             // 1. Send more fee ethAmount than the necessary. 1.19 amount.
348:             // 2. Assert the balance in the distributor is 0.56 which is the correct fee calculation
349:             // 3. Assert the balance in the Academy contract is positive which means the club owner does not
350:             // get back his excedent fee.
351:             //
352:             const divisionTier = 4;
353:             const generationIds = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
354:             //
355:             // 1. Send more fee ethAmount than the necessary. 1.19 amount
356:             //
357:             // DivisionTier 0 is 0.17 fee so 0.17 fee * 7 generationIds = 1.19 is send to the Academy contract
358:             const ethAmount = ethers.BigNumber.from(divisionFees[0]).mul(
359:                 generationIds.length // 1.19
360:             );
361:             expect(ethAmount.toString()).to.equal("1190000000000000000");
362:             await expect(

371:                         {
372:                             value: ethAmount,
373:                         }
374:                     )

376:             const distributorBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
377:                 distributor.address
378:             );
379:             const academyBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
380:                 academy.address
381:             );
382:             //

384:             //
385:             // DivisionTier 4 is 0.08 fee so 0.08 fee * 7 generationIds = 0.56 is send to the Distributor.
386:             expect(distributorBalanceAfter.toString()).to.equal("560000000000000000");
387:             //
388:             // 3. Assert the balance in the Academy contract is positive which means the club owner does not
389:             // get back his excedent fee.
390:             //
391:             // The surplus fee is 1.19 - 0.56 = 0.63. The exess fee is not returned to the Club Owner
392:             expect(academyBalanceAfter.toString()).to.equal("630000000000000000");
393:         });

## Code Snippet

The [FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#LL166C14-L166C25) accepts more `msg.value` than the necessary for fee payment.

```solidity
File: FootiumAcademy.sol
259:         if (msg.value < totalFee) {
260:             revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
261:         }
```

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Return the surplus amount or validates that the `msg.value` is the exact `totalFee` needed amount.
