# NFTs that do not implement safeTransferFrom are stuck in the contract

## Summary
For example, CryptoPunks, a leading NFT, does not implement safeTransferFrom; the `FootiumEscrow` mechanism allows sending to escrow but not withdrawing. As a result, those NFTs are stuck forever.
## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumEscrow` provides` transferERC721` as a means of extracting ERC721. It invokes `erc721Contract.safeTransferFrom`, but NFTs that do not implement this properly cannot transfer. The problem here is that there is no restriction on sending such NFTs to escrow, but they cannot be withdrawn.
## Impact
NFTs such as CryptoPunks are stuck forever.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either implement a dedicated implementation or clearly state in the terms and conditions that it is not guaranteed.
