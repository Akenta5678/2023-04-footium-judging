# FootiumEscrow_Don't use approve() to decrease/increase allowance

## Summary

The `setApprovalForERC20` function sets `amount` as an allowance for `to` address to spend the escrow contract's `erc20Contract` tokens. This function allows the club owner to call the `ERC20.approve` function. In case when the club owner wants to change the preset allowance it is recommended to call `ERC20.increaseAllowance` or `ERC20.decreaseAllowance` instead of `ERC20.approve` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose the club owner preset allowance `M > 0` for `address(attacker)` (tx1) and wants to change allowance to `N > 0` (tx2). Attacker intercepts  tx2, and makes tx1.5 (`transferFrom(M)`). Then the attacker sends tx3 (`transferFrom(N)`). The attacker spent M + N tokens from the escrow contract.

## Impact

The club owner takes a risk of tokens loss when changes allowances through the `ERC20.approve` function in one transaction. In other case it is necessary to make two transactions to firstly reset allowances with approve(0).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended adding functions to call `ERC20.increaseAllowance` or `ERC20.decreaseAllowance`, or using “expected_current_allowance” as an argument.
