# Multiple clubs can mint the same player

## Summary
In the technical documentation, `generationIds` are defined as "the unique identifier of each player within the season cohort". However, the `mintPlayers` function does not check if the player has already been minted by other clubs. This means that multiple clubs can mint the same player for a season.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a player is minted, there are a few checks that take place. One of these ensures that a club cannot mint the same `generationId` twice.

```solidity
if (redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]) {
    revert PlayerAlreadyRedeemed(generationId);
}
```

However, there is no similar check to ensure that the `generationId` has not already been minted by another club.

## Impact
Multiple clubs can use the same `generationId` to mint a player for a season. This means that there can be multiple instances of the same player in a season.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a storage mapping that tracks which generation IDs have already been minted. This will allow an additional check to be performed to ensure that a player has not already been minted by another club.
