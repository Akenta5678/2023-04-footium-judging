The mintPlayers() function of FootiumAcademy will always revert doe to missing onERC721Received(https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received-address-address-uint256-bytes-)

## Vulnerability Detail
The Mint() function will always revert because it calles safeMint to FootiumEscrow, where the onERC721Received function is missing.
