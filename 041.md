# ERC-20 token transfers are unsafe

## Summary
ERC-20 token transfers sent by the Footium contracts do not have safety checks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `transfer()` function is used to transfer ERC-20 tokens. They do not check for the `bool` return value from the `transfer()` frunction. ERC-20 token implementations may deviate from the standard and may not revert on an unsuccessful transfer, and instead return a `bool` indicating whether the transfer was successful.
## Impact
For `FootiumPrizeDistributor`, the user's claimable tokens would be used up, even if the transfer was unsuccessful.

## Recommendation
Use the `safeTransfer()` function in OpenZeppelin's [`SafeERC20`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) library.
