# No validation check present for minting of academy players based on the seasons played

## Summary
Validation check not present for minting of academy players based on the seasons played
## Vulnerability Detail
The function mintPlayers in FootiumAcademy.sol, does not have any validation to check as mentioned in the technical docs i.e, Academy players can no longer be minted beyond their 3rd season, as mentioned for the seasonId.
## Impact
Academy players can be minted for more than three seasons and beyond as there is no such validation present.
## Code Snippet
# seasonId: The season cohort to mint players from. Academy players can no longer be minted beyond their 3rd season.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A mapping for the seasonId against the playerId should be the added and updated when the mintPlayers happen, as well as should have a  if check based on the mapping and to validate the seasonId for the academy players.
