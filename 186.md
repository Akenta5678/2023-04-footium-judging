# Claiming rewards may fail because transfer result is unchecked

## Summary
Claiming rewards from `FootiumPrizeDistributor` may fail because transfer result is unchecked.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens do not revert on transfer, but may return false. In that case we can see that this call would not revert:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L130

The prize claimer would not receive tokens, but value would be still deduced from claimer allocation:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L129

Since the transaction has not reverted, the user is unable to retry because her claimed value has been updated.

The vast majority of tokens deployed on arbitrum are safe from this, and openzeppelin erc20 implementations revert on transfer failure. However since the team claims the contracts should be compatible with all types of ERC20 tokens in the contest policy:

>Q: Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
>Any

This incompatibility is worth mentioning

## Impact
User is unable to claim rewards.

## Recommendation
Use openzeppelin's SafeERC20 library, to make sure the most types of tokens are handled correctly
