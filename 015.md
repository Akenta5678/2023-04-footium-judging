# FootiumEscrow token approval still stays even when Club NFT is sold / transferred

## Summary

FootiumEscrow token approval still stays even when Club NFT is sold / transferred

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is not about admin privilege, which clearly out of scope.

The owner of the FootiumClub NFT has acccess to the footiumEscrow fund

```solidity
modifier onlyClubOwner() {
	if (msg.sender != IERC721(footiumClubAddress).ownerOf(clubId)) {
		revert NotClubOwner(clubId, msg.sender);
	}
	_;
}
```

and can call setApprovalForERC20 and setApprovalForERC721

```solidity
function setApprovalForERC20(
	IERC20 erc20Contract,
	address to,
	uint256 amount
) external onlyClubOwner {
	erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
}

/**
 * @notice Sets approval for ERC721 tokens.
 * @param erc721Contract ERC721 contract address.
 * @param to The address of token spender.
 * @param approved Boolean flag indicating whether approved or not.
 * @dev only the club owner address allowed.
 */
function setApprovalForERC721(
	IERC721 erc721Contract,
	address to,
	bool approved
) external onlyClubOwner {
	erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(to, approved);
}
```

However, even though the club NFT transfered out to other address or the NFT is sold out, the previously granted allowance is never removed.

for example, user A owns the club NFT he approves a smart contract to have infinite allowance and a smart contract / account can transfer all USDC fund out of the escrow contract,

the escrow contract do not have USDC

then NFT transfered out to User B, and escrow accumulate 1000 USDC,

the contract set by user A can transfer that 1000 USDC but the allowance user A should be considered outdated!

## Impact

Prev Club NFT Owner can approve malicious contract or unintentionally grant allowance to contract, and new club NFT may not aware of the previously granted allowance and get rugged

Basically when the club NFT is transfered out / sold, he should lose access to the fund in Escrow contract, but with approval, he still has access to the fund

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I do not think the escrow's token spending allowance should be set in that way.
