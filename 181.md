# Transfer in `FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimERC20Prize()` could fail and cause the loss of user’s funds

## Summary

The user can call `FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimERC20Prize()` to claim the prize. And `totalERC20Claimed` would be updated once the token is transferred.  However, it uses `_token.transfer(_to, value);` instead of `safeTransfer`.

## Vulnerability Detail


`FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimERC20Prize()` uses `_token.transfer(_to, value);` to transfer the erc20 token. And `totalERC20Claimed` would be updated no matter if the transfer succeeds or not.

```solidity
    function claimERC20Prize(
        address _to,
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        …

        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }

        …
    }
```


## Impact

The user may not receive the price but `totalERC20Claimed` is updated. It cause the loss of user’s funds

## Recommendation

Use SafeERC20 and `safeTransfer` to ensure that the token transfer is successful.
