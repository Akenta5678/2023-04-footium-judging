# setDivisionFees should have offset parameter

## Summary
`setDivisionFees` always rewrites whole `divisionToFee` mapping and doesn't allows partial rewrites.

## Vulnerability Detail
`setDivisionFees` may cause trouble under special conditions. Protocol owners may be forced to urdently change division fees during gas spikes and in that case calling `setDivisionFees` will be extremely expensive and may even be rejected by miners because sending all fees every time makes transactions unnecessarily big.

## Impact
Protocol owners may not be able to change division fees under special conditions

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `offset` parameter in `setDivisionFees` that will allow partial rewrites

```solidity
function setDivisionFees(uint256[] memory _fees, uint256 offset) public onlyOwner {
  uint256 max = _fees.length;

  for (uint256 i = 0; i < max; ) {
    uint256 fee = _fees[i];
    divisionToFee[i + 1 + offset] = fee;

    unchecked {
      i++;
    }
  }

  emit ChangedDivisionFees(_fees, offset);
}
```
