# Overpayment error in Footium Academy Contract

## Summary
The Footium Academy contract allows for overpayment by a user in the `mintPlayers` function without any provisions for returning the overpaid amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `mintPlayers` function of the Footium Academy contract, the function `_validateMintingParams` checks if the value sent with the transaction is less than the required fee for minting players, but it does not check if the value sent is greater than the required fee. In the case where a user overpays, the extra funds are not returned and are effectively lost.
## Impact
This vulnerability allows for funds to be lost due to overpayment in the `mintPlayers` function. This can lead to a decrease in user confidence in the platform and potential financial loss.
## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L259

```solidity
        uint256 playerCount = generationIds.length;
        uint256 totalFee = playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier];
        if (msg.value < totalFee) {
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, a provision for returning overpaid funds in the mintPlayers function should be added. This can be done by checking if the value sent is greater than the required fee, and in that case, sending back the difference to the sender. Or simply by reverting the transaction if the value sent is not equal than the required fee.
