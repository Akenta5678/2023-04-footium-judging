# FootiumClub calls _mint instead of _safeMint

## Summary
The `footiumClub` contract has a [`safeMint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L65
) function which calls the `_mint` function from the ERC721 standard implemented by Openzeppelin. It's recommended to use the `_safeMint` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_safeMint` function has an extra check which makes sure if the receiver is a contract it's aware of the standard and is able to handle ERC721 tokens. The `safeMint` function from `footiumClub` is being called from the `footiumClubMinter` contract. It's possible a contract can be entered as a destination that does not support the ERC721 standard and the club token gets stuck in the receiving contract.

Note, after the club is being minted `footiumClubMinter` mints an initial squad of players, there `_safeMint` is used.

## Impact
It's possible the entered address is a contract that is not ERC721 compatible and the nft will be stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
[Link to code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L65
) 
```solidity
function safeMint(
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;
        _mint(to, tokenId);

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```
