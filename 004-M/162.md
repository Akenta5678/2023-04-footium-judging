# Use safeMint instead of mint in the FootiumClub contract

## Summary
Use `safeMint` instead of `mint` in `FootiumClub::safeMint`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function name `safeMint` in the FootiumClub contract is misleading because it is actually using the `mint` function (not the safe version), especially since all other Footium contracts use the `safeMint` function. It's important to note that if the `to` address is a contract that does not support the ERC721 standard, the NFT can become frozen in that contract.

This information is documented in ERC721Upgradeable.sol by OpenZeppelin:

Ref: [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L257-L291](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L257-L291)

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.
 *
 * WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible
 *
 * Requirements:
 *
 * - `tokenId` must not exist.
 * - `to` cannot be the zero address.
 *
 * Emits a {Transfer} event.
 */
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {
```

## Impact
The potential impact is the permanent loss (or 'stuck') of NFTs for users of the protocol. This could occur if the NFTs are minted to a contract that does not support the ERC721 standard or if they are mistakenly minted to the wrong address. Hence, this issue is considered to have a medium severity.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  _mint(to, tokenId);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure ERC721 implementation support, use `safeMint` instead of `mint`.
