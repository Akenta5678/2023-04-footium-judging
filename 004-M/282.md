# safeMint function doesn't have _checkOnERC721Received

## Summary
The [`safeMint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L56-L68) in FootiumClub isn't really a safeMint as it doesn't implement the `_checkOnERC721Received` check.
## Vulnerability Detail
The differince lies in that the [`safeMint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L61-L71) calls `_safeMint` from the Openzeppelin erc721 contract. The `safeMint()` function in FootiumClub calls [`_mint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L65) and hereby skip the `_checkOnERC721Received`.

## Impact
The `_checkOnERC721Received is used to ensure that the recipient can handle the transfer. Without this check there is a possibility that the tokens can be lost.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function safeMint(address to)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }

```

## Recommendation
Rename the function to mint() or call _mint instead of _safeMint
