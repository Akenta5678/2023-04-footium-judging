# `clubNft` will be lost if caller doesn't implement `ERC721 Receiver`(i.e if caller unable to handle incoming Erc721 Token)

## Summary
Minted clubNft will lost if receiver doesn't know how to handel upcoming Nft(ERC721 Token)
## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumClubMinter` Contract mints Nft(ClubNft) to any address via mint function,
Which calls further `safeMint()` of `FootiumClub` contract which code is as follows
```solidity
    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId) 
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) 
        nonReentrant 
        whenNotPaused
    {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

        _mint(to, tokenId); // @audit-issue nft will be lost

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```
Which directly call `_mint()` with `to` address and `tokenId`. As we known internal function `_mint()` doesn't have any 
```solidity
_checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, data),
"ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer"
```
check. So Thats why newly minted Nft will be lost if receiver contract doesn't implement ERC721Receiver.

But `_safeMint()` have that check for user contract,
So must use `_safeMint`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use _safeMint() instaed of _mint().
```solidity
    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId) 
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) 
        nonReentrant 
        whenNotPaused
    {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

-        _mint(to, tokenId); 
+        _safeMint(to, tokenId); 

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```
