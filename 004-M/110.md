# Unsafe minting of footiumClubs

## Summary
The `safeMint` function in the `FootiumClub` contract does not use the `safeMint` function of the `ERC721Upgradeable` contract, which could potentially result in `ERC721` tokens being locked in a contract that cannot handle them.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `safeMint` function in the `FootiumClub` contract mints a football club `NFT` to a user, creating an escrow object and putting it in a mapping pointing the club ID to the escrow. This keeps it one-to-one. However, instead of using the `safeMint` function of the `ERC721Upgradeable` contract, the _mint function is used. This can potentially result in `ERC721` tokens being locked in a contract that cannot handle them. Footium uses safe mint when minting `footiumPlayers` but are missing that functionality when minting `clubs`. 


## Impact
This vulnerability can potentially lead to `ERC721` tokens being locked in a contract that cannot handle them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that the `safeMint` function of the `ERC721Upgradeable` contract is used instead of the _mint function in the `FootiumClub` contract to prevent potential locking of `ERC721` tokens in a contract that cannot handle them. This will ensure that the minting process is safe and secure. The contract should be updated and re-deployed with the recommended change.
