# Use _safeMint instead of _mint for ERC721 in FootiumClub safeMint function

## Summary

Use _safeMint instead of _mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail

In FootiumClub, there is a safeMint function in which the 'to' address and 'tokenId' are passed as arguments. If the 'to' address is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721: A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

## Impact

Users may potentially lose their FootiumClub NFTs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use _safeMint instead of _mint to check if the receiving address supports the ERC721 implementation.
