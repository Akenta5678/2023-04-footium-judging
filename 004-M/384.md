# FootiumClub.safeMint should use ERC721Upgradeable._safeMint instead of ERC721Upgradeable._mint

## Summary
There are certain smart contracts that do not support ERC721, using ERC721Upgradeable._mint may result in the NFT being sent to such contracts.

Within ERC721Upgradeable._safeMint, there is addition check to make sure the receiver can handle the NFT properly.

    function _safeMint(
        address to, 
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes memory data
    ) internal virtual {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        require(
            _checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, data),
            "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer"
        );
    }   

## Vulnerability Detail
[FootiumClub.safeMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L65) is called by [FootiumClubMinter.mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#LL68C14-L68C18), if the __to__ is a smart contracts that do not support ERC721, the club will break

## Impact
The NFT may get stuck in the contract that does support ERC721.
