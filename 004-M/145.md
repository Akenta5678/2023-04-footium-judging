# No use of _safeMint() as safe guard for users when minting a new ClubNFT

## Summary
The [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L68-L81) function of the FootiumClubMinter contract calls the [safeMint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L56-L68) function of the FootiumClub contract and forwards the `to` parameter which is the account where the ClubNFT will be minted to.

Internally in the [safeMint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L56-L68) function of the FootiumClub contract, it calls the [_mint()](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L257-L291) function of the ERC721Upgradeable contract to mint the ClubNFT and set the `to` address as the NFT owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a contract account attempts to mint a ClubNFT, calling the `_mint()` function does not ensure that the receiver of the NFT is able to accept them. 


## Impact
Calling mint does not ensure that the receiver of the NFT is able to accept them.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use _safeMint() instead of mint() and make sure to add a Reentrancy guard to prevent reentrant calls when the `to` address is a contract
Refer to the [OZ ERC721Upgradeable contract inline documentation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L231-L255) to see in detail how _safeMint() ensures that a contract indeed receives the NFT
