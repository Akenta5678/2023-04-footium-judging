# Minted tokens might be lost when minted to contract that cannot handle it.

## Summary

The FootiumClub Contract´s `safeMint` function internally calls `_mint` instead of `_safeMint` which could lead to tokens be lost in contracts, that are not able to handle them.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a FootiumClub NFT is minted to a contract address, which is not a ERC721 Receiver it might be stuck there. Even if  the name of the used function `safeMint` implies there is a check for the ERC721Receiver Interface, this is not the case as the internal call uses `_mint` instead of `_safeMint`

## Impact

Minted Club Tokens might get stuck in Contract´s that cannot handle it.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L56-L68

```solidity
    function safeMint(
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

        _mint(to, tokenId); //@audit SafeMint but internal call goes to _mint

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `_safeMint` instead of `_mint`
