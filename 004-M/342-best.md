# Minting inconsistencies on FootiumPlayer and FootiumClub

## Summary

The `FootiumClub.sol` contract when minting uses `_mint()` instead of `_safeMint()` which can cause to mint a club to a contract who does not support nfts. On the other hand `FootiumPlayer.sol` uses `_safeMint()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary.

## Impact

`FootiumClub.sol` might mint a club NFT to a contract that cannot handle nfts.

Use `_safeMint()` as in FootiumPlayer.
