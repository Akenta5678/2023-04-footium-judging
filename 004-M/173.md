# FootiumClub safeMint method is misleadingly unsafe and can lead to stuck NFTs

## Summary
FootiumClub method safeMint can unsafely transfer to a contract not able to receive ERC721, and club NFT being stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumClub implements a safeMint function, which misleadingly calls the internal `_mint()` function, and does not check that the receiver is a ERC721Receiver.

## Impact
This can lead to NFTs being stuck in the destination contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`safeMint` method should call `_safeMint` function, which is correctly done in FootiumPlayer:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L70

If it is not desired to call a function on the destination (reentrancy concerns and such), the external function should be renamed to mint() to avoid confusion.
