# FootiumClub.safeMint() is not safe

## Summary
The `safeMint()` function inside `FootiumClub` calls the `_mint()` function, which is unsafe.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_mint()` function does not check if the receiver address is capable of handling ERC-721 tokens.
Since the receiver of the club ERC-721 token in this case is the user address, it can be any arbitrary account, including a contract that cannot handle ERC-721 tokens.
## Impact
If the recipient is a contract that does not interface with ERC-721 tokens, the club token would be frozen inside the recipient address, as it does not have any method to transfer it out.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `_safeMint()` function inside the `ERC721Upgradeable` contract instead of `_mint()`.
