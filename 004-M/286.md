# `FootiumClub` NFT can be lost if minted to a non compatible contract

## Summary

The `FootiumClub` NFT contract doesn't call the `onERC721Received()` function on target contract to ensure the contract is able to receive NFTs when minting. This may lead to irretrievable club NFTs.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [ERC721 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) defines `safeTransfer()` and `safeTransferFrom()` functions to avoid sending of NFTs to addresses (contracts) which cannot handle NFTs as this would lead to irretrievable NFTs. This check is done by calling `onERC721Received()` on target address in cases when target is a contract.

In the similar manner OpenZeppelin ERC721 libraries, which are imported across the protocol, provide the `safeMint()` functions, with the same check (calling `onERC721Received()` on target contract). The `FootiumClub` contract however implements a `safeMint()` functionality, but skips this check for safety. This means minted NFTs can potentially be lost if sent to a contract which can't handle NFTs.

The word "safe" in the `FootiumClub.safeMint()` function is especially misleading as it implies that the mentioned "safe" check is done.

## Impact

Possible loss of club NFTs when minting.

## Code Snippet

[FootiumClub.sol L65](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L65)

```solidity
    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
    {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

        _mint(to, tokenId);

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would recommend to use the `_safeMint()` function from OpenZeppelin `ERC721Upgradeable.sol` instead of `_mint()`.
