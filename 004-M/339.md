# Use safemint instead of mint for ERC721 FootiumClub

## Summary
Use safemint instead of mint for ERC721 FootiumClub

## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumClub.safeMint` calls `_mint` to mint a new club. However, `_safemint` should be used instead. because if the address that will receive the club is a contract address that doesn't support ERC721, the NFT club can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721,

> A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

	FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);

	_mint(to, tokenId);

	emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
```
