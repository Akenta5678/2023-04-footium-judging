# NFT can be locked when calling _mint to a contract that does not support ERC721 protocol

## Summary
Use safeMint instead of _mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail
When the safeMint() function is called, the _mint() function is executed to mint a new NFT representing a new club. 
However, if the receiver address does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract. 

## Impact
Users possibly lose their NFTs
