# FootiumClub NFT can be locked when calling _mint function to mint it to a contract that does not support ERC721 protocol

## Summary
FootiumClub NFT can be locked when calling _mint function to mint it to a contract that does not support ERC721 protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling the safeMint function for minting an FootiumClub NFT, the OpenZeppelin's ERC721Upgradeable contract's _mint function is used to mint the NFT to a receiver.
If such receiver is a contract that does not support the ERC721 protocol, the NFT will be locked and cannot be retrieved.

## Impact
The following can occur when minting an NFT
1. The safeMint function is called with msg.sender or the to input corresponding to a contract.
2. The OpenZeppelin's ERC721Upgradeable contract's _mint function is called with msg.sender or to used in Step 1 as the receiver address.
3. Since calling the OpenZeppelin's ERC721Upgradeable contract's _mint function does not execute the same contract's _checkOnERC721Received function,
it is unknown if the receiving contract inherits from the IERC721ReceiverUpgradeable interface and implements the onERC721Received function or not.
It is possible that the receiving contract does not support the ERC721 protocol, which causes the minted NFT to be locked.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
    {
     	FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId); // @audit address(this)?
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

        _mint(to, tokenId);

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Use `_safeMint` instead of `_mint`
