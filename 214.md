# ERC20 approval can lead to front-running exploits

## Summary

ERC20 approval can lead to front-running exploits.

## Vulnerability Detail

`FootiumEscrow.sol:setApprovalForERC20` calls the `approve` function of an ERC20 token without any additional check or action.

```solidity
75:     function setApprovalForERC20(
76:         IERC20 erc20Contract,
77:         address to,
78:         uint256 amount
79:     ) external onlyClubOwner {
80:         erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
81:     }
```

This can lead to a well-known front-running attack consisting of the following:

1.  Alice decides to allow Bob to spend 1,000 of her tokens. She calls the `approve` function with the argument equal to 1,000.
2.  Alice rethinks her previous decision and now she wants to allow Bob to spend only 300 tokens. She calls the `approve` function again with the argument value equal to 300.
3.  Bob notices the second transaction before it is actually validated and front-runs Alice's transaction, calling the `transferFrom` function, and spends 1,000 tokens.
4.  Bob has already spent 1,000 Alice’s tokens. The number of Alice’s tokens that Bob can transfer is equal to zero.
5.  Then Alice’s second transaction is validated, so Bob’s allowance is set to 300.
6.  Bob spends 300 more tokens by calling the `transferFrom` function.

## Impact

The approved address could be able to transfer out from the escrow more amount than expected.
