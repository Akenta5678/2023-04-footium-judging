# Prize merkle tree amount and recipient can be calculated incorrectly

## Summary

Prize merkle tree amount and recipient can be calculated incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/technical-docs/FootiumPrizeDistributor.md#claimerc20prizeaddress-_to-ierc20upgradeable-_token-uint256-_amount-bytes32-calldata-_proof) of `FootiumPrizeDistributor`'s `claimERC20Prize` and `claimETHPrize` functions it says `The function checks to see whether the function caller owns the club that they're claiming prizes for`. However, this check does not exist in the code:

```solidity
144:     function claimETHPrize(
145:         address _to,
146:         uint256 _amount,
147:         bytes32[] calldata _proof
148:     ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
149:         if (_to != msg.sender) {
150:             revert InvalidAccount();
151:         }
152: 
153:         if (
154:             !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
155:                 _proof,
156:                 ethMerkleRoot,
157:                 keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_to, _amount))
158:             )
159:         ) {
160:             revert InvalidETHMerkleProof();
161:         }
162: 
163:         uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];
164: 
165:         if (value > 0) {
166:             totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;
167: 
168:             (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
169:             if (!sent) {
170:                 revert FailedToSendETH(value);
171:             }
172:         }
173: 
174:         emit ClaimETH(_to, value);
175:     }
```

## Impact

In case the owner of the club changes, to ensure that the new owner will be able to claim future rewards, users need to rely on the off-chain merkle tree generation accounting for the change in ownership. If that change is not detected, the merkle tree will be granting the price to the old owner.

In the merkle tree generation, it will have to be accounted also the possibility of an address owning more than one club, so that `_amount` is the summation of the prizes for all clubs owned in the present or the past.

Given that tracking all these situations off-chain can be prone to many accounting errors, the ownership of the club should be abstracted away and the prizes be associated to the club instead.

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation

Instead of including the `_to` address in the merkle tree, include the club id and check that `msg.sender` is the owner of the club.
