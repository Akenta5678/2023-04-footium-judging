# `FootiumAcademy`: Excess minting fees are not returned.

## Summary

In `FootiumAcademy`, there is a function `mintPlayers()` that allows whitelisted users to mint academy players with an ETH fee. However, excess fees are not returned to the minter.

We also show a scenario where the admin is not malicious, but it's entirely possible for a user to overpay the fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current total fee is defined to be `divisionToFee[divisionTier]` per player.

```solidity
uint256 totalFee = playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier];
```

The fee is used when `mintPlayers()` is called. At any time, the admin may, non-maliciously, change the minting fees. Should a player mint at a moment nearby, the excess fees are not returned unless admin intervention happens.

### Proof of concept

We use `e2e.ts` test for this. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/test/e2e.ts#L303-L314

Modify the above lines to as follow:

```typescript
await academyContract
    .connect(clubOwner1)
    .mintPlayers(
        seasonId,
        clubId1,
        divisionTier1,
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        clubDivProof,
        {
            value: ethers.utils.parseEther("2.7"), // 10 * 0.17 = 1.7
        }
);
const excessBal = await ethers.provider.getBalance(academyContract.address);
expect(excessBal.eq(ethers.utils.parseEther("1"))); // should've been 0
```

The test will pass. As demonstrated, excess fees will remain in the contract.

## Impact

Leakage of value, as the minter may have to rely on an admin to recover the excess fee, incurring expensive gas cost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Return the excess value to the user. Add the following lines to the end of `mintPlayers()`

```solidity
// forward excess fee back to msg.sender
uint256 excessFee = msg.value - totalFee;
(bool sent2, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: excessFee}("");
if (!sent2) {
    revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
}
```
