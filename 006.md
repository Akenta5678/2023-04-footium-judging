# Sensitive signature stored in constant variable

## Summary

By always returning a constant variable as the "correct" option an attacker can easily forge a signature, by just using the constant variable stored in the contract

## Vulnerability Detail
Depending on what the signature can be used for, it can lead to a loss of funds for the users
## Impact
High impact, leads to loss of funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity  

 function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature)
        external
        view
        returns (bytes4 magicValue)
    {
        if (
            ECDSA.recover(hash, signature) ==
            IERC721(footiumClubAddress).ownerOf(clubId)
        ) {
            return MAGICVALUE;
        }

        return 0xffffffff;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't store a sensitive piece of info in an open source contract, but compute it within a function call not giving away the value, and removing the constant variable here:     [bytes4 private constant MAGICVALUE = 0x1626ba7e;](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L16)
