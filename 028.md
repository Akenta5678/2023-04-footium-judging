# FootiumPrizeDistributor contract's claimERC20Prize should use safetransfer instead.

## Summary
In the claimERC20Prize function, while transfer the token, the success/ failure of that transfer is not checked and hence failures are ignored.

## Vulnerability Detail
Transfer with out checks can result in incorrect accounting. It is always recommended to check for the status of the transfer.

## Impact
Could view as loss of funds from receiving account's point of view.
