# FootiumPrizeDistributor cannot withdraw the ETH in the contract

## Summary
FootiumPrizeDistributor cannot withdraw the ETH in the contract
## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumPrizeDistributor can accept ETH. If a user accidentally sends eth to the contract, they must use `claimETHPrize()` to withdraw it, but the excess eth cannot be withdrawn.

```solidity
    receive() external payable {//@audit  
        emit ETHReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
