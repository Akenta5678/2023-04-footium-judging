# lack of refund mechanism for overpayment

## Summary
[FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166C14-L172) receives ETH, and mints players. Within the function, [FootiumAcademy._validateMintingParams](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L259-L261), **msg.value** is checked to make sure there is enough ETH for fee.

But if the **msg.sender(club owner)** sends more ETH, the overpayment is not returned to the club owner.
