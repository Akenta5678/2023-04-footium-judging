# Use safeTransfer consistently instead of transfer

## Summary
Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead, return false (e.g. ZRX).
https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/#no-revert-on-failure
transfer is directly used to send tokens in many places in the contract and the return value is not checked.
If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.

For example, in the claimERC20Prize function, if `_token` is ZRX, the user will be unable to claim the prize. 

Similarly, this issue exists in the transferERC20 function as well.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L110

```solidity
function transferERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L130

```solidity
if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }
```

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20â€™s safeTransfer function
