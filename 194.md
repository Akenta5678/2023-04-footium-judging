# `FootiumEscrow.sol` contract `withdraw` and `transferXXX` function could be front-run to scam traders

## Summary

`FootiumEscrow.sol` contract `withdraw` and `transferXXX` function could be used to scam traders

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: FootiumEscrow.sol
105     function transferERC20(
106         IERC20 erc20Contract,
107         address to,
108         uint256 amount
109     ) external onlyClubOwner {
110         erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
111     }
--skip--
120     function transferERC721(
121         IERC721 erc721Contract,
122         address to,
123         uint256 tokenId
124     ) external onlyClubOwner {
125         erc721Contract.safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, tokenId);
126     }
--skip--
132     function withdraw() external onlyClubOwner {
133         uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
134         if (balance > 0) {
135             (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
136             if (!sent) {
137                 revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
138             }
139         }
140     }
```

Each clubNFT has an Escrow contract to store assets, and the owner of the club can control the assets in it. The `transferERC20`,  `transferERC721` and `withdraw` functions are used to transfer assets. The problem now is that when the club is traded, the original owner may front-run these three interfaces to steal the funds of the club.

The attack path is as follows:

1. Alias owns ClubA
2. Bob is going to buy ClubA from Alias
3. Alias front-run `transferERC20`, `transferERC72` and `withdraw` functions to transfer funds before a transaction
4. Bob completes the purchase, but with an empty ClubA (the funds have already been transferred)

## Impact

User funds may be stolen
