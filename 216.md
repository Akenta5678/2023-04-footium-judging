# Insecure transfer/renouncement of ownership in project that heavily depends on ownership checks for usage of critical functionality

## Summary

The Footium project relies heavily on access control checks based on smart contract ownership. This becomes visible quickly counting the occurrences of the `onlyOwner` modifier of the OpenZeppelin `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` contract which constraints critical functions to be only executed by the set smart contract owner.

Despite the criticality of ownership in the Footium project changing the ownership is still done in a minimal and insecure 1-step fashion. This puts the projects functionality and all contained funds at risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's use `FootiumAcademy.sol` as an example.

The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin `OwnableUpgradeable` in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L28.

This allows the associated `onlyOwner` modifier to be used for protecting critical functionality to only be called by the smart contract owner which is set to the deployer (msg.sender) of the contract in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L76

The `onlyOwner` modifier is e.g. used for pausing/unpausing the contract, setting division fees and withdrawing all ETH contained in the contract balance. Hence, very critical operations.

Looking deeper into the implementation of `OwnableUpgradeable` it becomes clear that for the changes of ownership (governing who can call functions with `onlyOwner` modifier) a simple 1-step process is implemented.

- Transfer of ownership is done in 1 step: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol#L74
- Renouncement of ownership is done in 1 step: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol#L66

## Impact

Due to the simple change of ownership implementation the project is at risk to be bricked or drained through an accidental non-recoverable ownership change.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a 2-step process for ownership change by making all Footium contracts inherit from OpenZeppelin `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` where currently `OwnableUpgradeable` is used. See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2StepUpgradeable.sol.

Using it a new owner can be appointed by the current owner. But a change in ownership is only executed once the appointed account accepts the ownership.

Be aware that using `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` does not remove the risk of calling the `renounceOwnership` function as `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` extends `Ownable2Upgradeable` and this function is therefore still available.

To remove this risk consider creating a smart contract that extends `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` and overwrites `renounceOwnership` to have no effect. Contracts should then inherit this contract (e.g. named `Ownable2StepUpgradeableNotRenouncable`) instead of directly inheriting `Ownable2StepUpgradeable`.

```Solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/Ownable2StepUpgradeable.sol";

contract Ownable2StepUpgradeableNotRenouncable is Ownable2StepUpgradeable {
    // Override the renounceOwnership function to prevent its usage
    function renounceOwnership() public override(OwnableUpgradeable, Ownable2StepUpgradeable) onlyOwner {
        revert("Ownership cannot be renounced");
    }
}
```
