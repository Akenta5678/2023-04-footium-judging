# Excess of Ether is not refunded

## Summary

Excess of Ether is not refunded.

## Vulnerability Detail

`FootiumAcademy.sol:mintPlayers` calculates the `totalFee`, checks that the value sent is equal to or higher than `totalFee`, and sends `totalFee` to the prize distributor contract. If the amount of Ether sent by the user is higher than `totalFee`, the excess amount will remain in the contract.

## Impact

If the user sends more Ether than required by mistake in the total fee calculations or for any other reason, will lose the excess amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation

```diff
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
        }

+       if (msg.value > totalFee) {
+           (bool refunded, ) = msg.sender.call{value: msg.value - totalFee}("");
+           if (!refunded) {
+               revert FailedToSendETH(msg.value - totalFee);
+           }
+       }
```
