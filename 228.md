# No limit on division fee set

## Summary
There is no maximum limit on what the amount of division fee can be.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumAcademy.sol` , the function `setDivisionFees` is used for setting the division fees, `divisionToFee`. But there is no max limit on the value of fee. 
Due to this a owner can set a very high amount of fee

## Impact
Owner can grief users by setting a very amount of division fee, required while minting Footium players
