# Club buyers may lose all players and tokens in escrow

## Summary

The current design of Footium Club does not guarantee that the buyer of a club NFT will also receive the players and tokens stored in the FootiumEscrow contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

A Footium Club owns its FootiumEscrow contract and all the resources in it, which include all the Footium player NFTs and ERC20 tokens. However, when a FootiumClub NFT is listed for sale in the marketplace, the seller of the club NFT can front-run and transfer all the resources in the escrow to a different account before the buyer completes the purchase. The buyer of the club NFT will end up with an empty club that has no players or tokens, contrary to their expectation.

This can happen because there is no mechanism to prevent or restrict the transfer of resources from the escrow contract once the club NFT is listed for sale. The seller can withdraw all the NFTs and tokens from the escrow contract at any time.

```javascript
    function transferERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
    }

    function transferERC721(
        IERC721 erc721Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc721Contract.safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, tokenId);
    }

    function withdraw() external onlyClubOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }

## Impact

This vulnerability allows sellers of FootiumClub NFTs to cheat buyers and take away all the assets in the escrow contract before selling. This discourages buyers from buying clubs and undermines the trust and value of the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement one of those: 
- Add logic to enforce a minimum number of player NFTs and assets that have to remain in the escrow contract for each club, or
- Add timelock logic to delay the transfer of resources from the escrow contract to prevent sellers from cheating.
