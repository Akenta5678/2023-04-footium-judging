# When a club is sold, the buyer can be rugged

## Summary
By representing club ownership via ERC-721 tokens, clubs are able to be sold on secondary markets. However, a seller can easily rug a buyer by transferring all assets out of the club escrow contract before transferring the club NFT to the buyer.

## Vulnerability Detail
Generally, when using ERC-721 tokens to represent ownership, the benefit that you gain interoperability within a broad ecosystem of markets and services. However, as Footium clubs are currently implemented, they are a poor fit for the majority of them.

This is because, the entirety of a clubs value is not in the club NFT but in the assets they hold in their escrow contract. When a club is sold, there is no assurance that the escrow assets will also be transferred to the buyer.

## Impact
Club buyers are at risk of being rugged.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a timelock mechanism that prevents the seller from withdrawing assets from the escrow contract for a period of time. This would allow buyers to be confident that they will receive the assets that the club escrow contract holds.
