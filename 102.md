# FootiumEscrow is not future proof - Assistant Managers cannot control the assets in FootiumEscrow.sol

## Summary

FootiumEscrow is not future proof - Assistant Managers cannot control the assets in FootiumEscrow.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

In the technical documentation, protocol states, under [Escrow Contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/technical-docs/General.md), that:
```md
The owner of the club can control these assets, and in future they will be able to grant access to assistant managers too.
```

In FootiumEscrow.sol, the functions to approve/transfer/withdraw can only be called by the owner because of the modifier onlyClubOwner,

```solidity
    function withdraw() external onlyClubOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```

which is the person that owns the clubID NFT.

```solidity
    modifier onlyClubOwner() {
        if (msg.sender != IERC721(footiumClubAddress).ownerOf(clubId)) {
            revert NotClubOwner(clubId, msg.sender);
        }
        _;
    }
```

No other person can control the assets unless they have the club NFT.


## Impact

Assistant Managers cannot control the assets in FootiumEscrow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would modify the code to ensure that future assistant manager(s) addresses will be allowed to control the assets. Since the club owner is assumed to be trusted, this trust should be extended to the managers too. I would refactor the code so that the managers can eventually control the assets, otherwise a new contract has to be created with new functionality which will be pretty troublesome. Here is the recommended change:

```solidity
/// 1. Create a mapping for the manager(s) addresses
mapping (address => bool) allowManager;

        modifier onlyClubOwner() {
        if (msg.sender != IERC721(footiumClubAddress).ownerOf(clubId)) {
            revert NotClubOwner(clubId, msg.sender);
        }
        _;
    }

/// 2. Create a new modifier that checks club owner or manager
    modifier onlyClubOwnerOrManager() {
        if (msg.sender != IERC721(footiumClubAddress).ownerOf(clubId) || allowManager[msg.sender] == false) {
            revert NotClubOwner(clubId, msg.sender);
        }
        _;
    }
/// 3. Only the club owner can choose who to become a manager and remove manager access
    function addManager(address _address) onlyClubOwner {
     allowManager[_address] = true; 
}

    function removeManager(address _address) onlyClubOwner {
     allowManager[_address] = false; 
}

/// 4. All functions should be able to be called by either the club owner or a future manager now
    function withdraw() external onlyClubOwnerOrManager{
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```
