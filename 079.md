# Clubs cannot claim prizes from the prize distributor

## Summary
According to the documentation, the claim functions are supposed to "check to see whether the function caller owns the club that they're claiming prizes for". However, because of how prize claiming is currently implemented, there is no way for owners to claim prizes for the teams they own.

## Vulnerability Detail
For rewards, the Merkle tree leaves store a hash containing the `_token`, `_to`, and `_amount`. 

```solidity
if (
    !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
        _proof,
        erc20MerkleRoot,
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_token, _to, _amount))
    )
) { ...
```

The technical docs imply that prizes are rewarded to clubs and that club owners can claim prizes for their clubs. However, the `claimERC20Prize` function only allows for prizes to be claimed by the address that is stored in the Merkle tree leaf. The `msg.sender` is checked against the `_to` address in the Merkle tree leaf.

```solidity
if (_to != msg.sender) {
    revert InvalidAccount();
}
```

Club escrows currently have no functionality to call these claim functions. Which means that they cannot claim these prizes directly. I assume the entire reason clubs can manage their own Ether and tokens is because they are supposed to be able to claim these prizes. However, this is not possible.

## Impact
Clubs are not able to claim prizes from the prize distributor.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Handle prize claiming in a different manner.

Record prizes to club IDs instead of addresses, check that message caller is the owner of the club, and transfer the prize to the club escrow.

For example:

```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(
    uint256 _clubId,
    IERC20Upgradeable _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    if (msg.sender != footiumClub.ownerOf(_clubId)) {
        revert NotClubOwner(clubId, msg.sender);
    }

    if (
        !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
            _proof,
            erc20MerkleRoot,
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_token, _clubId, _amount))
        )
    ) {
        revert InvalidERC20MerkleProof();
    }

    uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_clubId];

    if (value > 0) {
        totalERC20Claimed[_token][_clubId] += value;
        _token.transfer(footiumClub.clubToEscrow(_clubId), value);
    }

    emit ClaimERC20(_token, _clubId, value);
}
```
