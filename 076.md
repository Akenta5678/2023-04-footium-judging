# Sale of Club NFT may be frontrunned

## Summary
Escrow ownership is checked through the owner of the NFT, which may be susceptible to frontrunning attack
 
## Vulnerability Detail

Club ownership is tradable via FootiumClub NFTs. Lets assume 2 parties trades a club on a marketplace. Seller of the club may observe the mempool and frontrun `transferFrom()` tx with a bundle of multiple txs that transfer all player NFTs out of the escrow. Doing so would cause seller to receive the whole amount of sale price but the buyer would receive a club with 0 players, and potentially 0 assets in escrow.

## Impact

## Recommendation

Make the assets in the escrow freezable and mandate that the escrow must be frozen in order to transfer/sale the club NFT.
