# Footium.sol: Did not approve to zero first

## Summary

Allowance is not set to zero first before changing the allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

The following attempt to call the `approve()` function without setting the allowance to zero first.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Sets approval for ERC20 tokens.
     * @param erc20Contract ERC20 contract address.
     * @param to The address of token spender.
     * @param amount Token amount to spend.
     * @dev only the club owner address allowed.
     */
    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
```

However, if the token involved is an ERC20 token that does not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value, it will break a number of key functions or features of the protocol as the `FootiumEscrow.setApprovalForERC20()` function is utilised extensively within the protocol

## Impact

A number of features within protocol will not work if the approve function reverts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance.
