# `FootiumClub`'s `safeMint` does not check if the receiving address supports ERC-721 transfers.

## Summary
`FootiumClub`'s `safeMint` does not check if the receiving address supports ERC-721 transfers, therefore leading to the possibility of club tokens being stuck forever in contracts incompatible with ERC-721.

## Vulnerability Detail
Although `safeMint` is not included in the [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard, it is widely present in ERC-721 contracts. All major ERC-721 implementations ([Openzeppeling](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/a7ee03565b4ee14265f4406f9e38a04e0143656f/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L244-L250), [Solmate](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/2001af43aedb46fdc2335d2a7714fb2dae7cfcd1/src/tokens/ERC721.sol#L204-L217), [Solady](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/e0626f63d46afda587439f93f6194570af06bf36/src/tokens/ERC721.sol#L484-L487)) have `_safeMint` internal methods, and all of them work the same way. First minting the selected `tokenId` to the desired address and then checking if the receiving address supports ERC-721 transfers (by calling the `onERC721Received` method if the receiving address is a smart-contract)

Consider the following snippet from the `safeMint` function in the `FootiumClub` contract. It does mint the selected `tokenId` to the receiving address, but it does not check if the receiving address supports ERC-721 transfers, therefore if the receiving address is a contract and does not support those operations, the minted token will be stuck forever in the receiving address.

```solidity
function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
    external
    onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
{
    FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
    clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

    _mint(to, tokenId);

    emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
}
```

## Impact
As described above, due to the lack of checks in the `FootiumClub`'s `safeMint` method, the football club token can be minted to addresses that do not support ERC721 transfers, resulting in those tokens being lost as there is no way to transfer them out of the receiving address. Therefore I classify this issue as a high severity one.

## Tool used
Manual Review 

## Recommendation
The `FootiumClub` already inherits `ERC721Upgradeable`, so consider using `_safeMint` instead of `_mint`, as shown in the diff below.
