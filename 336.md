# safeERC20 instead of IERC20

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When working with different erc20 tokens as in ```FootiumEscrow```, it is safer to used the safeERC20 wrapper than the IERC20 interface. 
Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful. To use this library you can add a using SafeERC20 for IERC20; statement to your contract, which allows you to call the safe operations as token.safeTransfer(…​), etc. Source: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20
## Impact

Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false when approvals or transfers are initiated.

In the function above, we interact directly with the token interface which does not handle bool values returned

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


The transfer function would become 
```solidity
    function transferERC20(
        SafeERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.safeTransfer(to, amount);
    }

```


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L75-L81 would now call ``` erc20Contract.safeApprove(to, amount)```
