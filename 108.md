# No upper bound in setting _royaltyFeePercentage

## Summary
`_royaltyFeePercentage` can be set upto 10_000 which would claim 100% of the sale price.
## Vulnerability Detail
`_royaltyFeePercentage` should be relatively small and also is a sensitive parameter which should be checked. 
This enhance users trust and as well as curb rug pulling users.
## Impact
Contract owner can claim 100% of the NFT sale price.

```solidity
function setRoyaltyInfo(address _receiver, uint96 _royaltyFeePercentage)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        _setDefaultRoyalty(_receiver, _royaltyFeePercentage);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set an upper limit for `_royaltyFeePercentage` e.g `require(_royaltyFeePercentage <= 500)` to the constructor and  to `setRoyaltyInfo`
