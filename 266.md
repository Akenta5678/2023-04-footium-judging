# Lack of validation to check whether or not the total supply (initial supply) of clubs would be `3060`, which lead to unexpected situation that more than `3060` clubs will be minted

## Summary
Within the FootiumClubMinter#`mint()`, there is no validation to check whether or not the total supply (initial supply) of clubs would be `3060`. 
This lead to unexpected situation that more than `3060` clubs will be minted. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the FootiumClubMinter#`mint()`, the FootiumClub#`safeMint()` would be called to mint a Footium club like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L69
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Mint a Footium club and starting squad of players.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can mint.
     * @param to The account to mint to.
     * @param tokenId The club ID to mint.
     */
    function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
        footiumClub.safeMint(to, tokenId);  /// @audit

        address escrowAddress = footiumClub.clubToEscrow(tokenId);

        for (uint256 i; i < INITIAL_MINT; ) {
            uint256 playerId = footiumPlayer.safeMint(escrowAddress);
            emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId);

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

According to the "Football Club NFT's" part in the [technical documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/technical-docs/General.md#football-club-nfts), the initial supply of clubs would be `3060` clubs
> _The Footium Football Club NFT's live on Ethereum mainnet and follow the [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721#:~:text=ERC721%20is%20a%20standard%20for,across%20a%20number%20of%20contracts.) standard. The mint took place in November 2021 with an initial supply of `3060` clubs._

However, within the FootiumClubMinter#`mint()`, there is no validation to check whether or not the total supply (initial supply) of clubs would be `3060`. 

## Impact
This lead to unexpected situation that more than `3060` clubs will be minted.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the FootiumClubMinter#`mint()`, consider adding an input validation like this in order to check whether or not the `tokenId` would be less than `3060` that is the maximum number of clubs to be allowed to mint. 
```solidity
    function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
+       require(tokenId < 3060, "tokenId must be less than 3060");
        footiumClub.safeMint(to, tokenId);
        ...
    }
```
