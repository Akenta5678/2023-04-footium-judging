# the club owner can fraud to reduce the fee of minting new players

## Summary

in the	 **FootiumAcademy.sol** contract there is function to mint players from the academy, and this function add fees on each player get minted ,these fees are calculated depending on the current **divisionTier** of the club.
Noting that the players dont have to be from the current season,while they could be from two previous seasons. 
so: 
if the club guarantees his location in the first position in the league ,it will be keen on minting players quickly before ascending to the higher division to reduce the fees that it will pay on each player. 
and the same issue to the clubs in the three last positions, they will  wait until they drop to a lower division

## Impact
If there are a lot of malicious clubs this will lead to a decrease in prizes to other clubs that are located in the middle of the league table.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

calculate the fees depending on which division the club was in in the season the player was playing (the **seasonId** reflects the season in which the player was playing with the club)
