# safeMint in FootiumClub is not "safe"

## Summary

safeMint() function in `FootiumClub` contract is not "safe".

## Vulnerability Detail

Usually, minting functions are marked as "safe" in their names when they check if the token holder address supports `onERC721Received` interface. In false cases "safe" minting function should revert, this protects from cases when NFT is stuck on the address that could not transfer NFTs.
In `FootiumClub` contract we could see `safeMint()` function, but it's calling the internal `_mint()` function instead of `_safeMint()`, which means it does not check token receiver `onERC721Received` interface.

## Impact

Club minter could be misled by `safeMint()` function name, expecting a revert in case club NFT is minted to a smart contract address that can't transfer NFTs. This could lead to sticking NFT tokens.

## Code Snippet

_mint() called inside safeMint() function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L65
```solidity
    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
    {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

        _mint(to, tokenId);

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use _safeMint() internal function instead of _mint().
