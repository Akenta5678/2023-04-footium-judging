# No upper limit on royalty settings

## Summary
The owner can set Royalty in FootiumPlayer, but there is no upper limit. This leads to undue deprivation of the user's assets. Also, by suddenly raising the cap by front-running, it is possible to impose fees that are not expected by the user.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumPlayer`'s `setRoyaltyInfo`, the owner can set the royalty by `_setDefaultRoyalty`. However, this has no upper limit or time limit, so it can be set unexpectedly by the user.
## Impact
Users may be subject to unreasonable fees. This is a form of theft.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set an upper limit. In addition, when using royalties, set a user-agreed fee as a parameter.
