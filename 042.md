# Loss of funds to msg.sender from missing excess eth refund in FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers()

## Summary
FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers() fails to refund excess eth to msg.sender, resulting in loss of funds for msg.sender if msg.value > totalFee

## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumAcademy.mintPlayers() calls _validateMintingParams() which allows execution if msg.value >= totalFee [L259-261](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L259-L261)

Then mintPlayers() sends totalFee to _prizeDistributorAddress [L207-211](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L207-L211).

If caller sent msg.value > totalFee, (msg.value - totalFee) remains stuck in FootiumAcademy contract. This excess should be refunded to msg.sender.

## Impact
Loss of funds to msg.sender if msg.value > totalFee

## Code Snippet
_validateMintingParams() allows execution if msg.value >= totalFee [L259-261](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L259-L261)

mintPlayers() sends totalFee to _prizeDistributorAddress [L207-211](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L207-L211).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Basic option: If msg.value > totalFee, refund (msg.value - totalFee) to msg.sender

Better option: 
1) implement a public function to calculate the fee:

```solidity
function getTotalFee(uint256            divisionTier, 
                     uint256[] calldata generationIds) public returns (uint256) {
    return generationIds.length * divisionToFee[divisionTier];
}
```

2) Change _validateMintingParams() to use this new function to calculate the fee, and revert if msg.value != totalFee

This approach provides callers a public interface to have the fee calculated for them so they can send the exact amount (no excess refund required), and there's no code duplication since both callers & internal code ends up using the same fee calculation since the new function is public.

The withdraw() method could also be removed as there would be no need for it, since FootiumAcademy wouldn't ever store any eth.
