# User may not be able to claim any rewards due to use of transfer in `claimErc20Prize`

## Summary
in FootiumPrizeDistribution contract in claimErc20Prize function uses the transfer instead of safeTransfer which can lead to unclaimed prize for user if the token don't revert on failed transfer and instead return boolean false on revert like ZRX
## Vulnerability Detail
As in sherlock discription the protocol allows all erc20 token which includes the implementation of tokens which do not revert on transfer failure but instead return a boolean false, so if such token is being used as reward token for prize distribution is user claim his erc20 reward and boolean false is returned it can lead updating the mapping and user will be unable to claim any reward.

Look at following snippet from the `claimErc20Prize` function:

```solidity
        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }
```
so if value is greater than 0 and mapping is updated for token claimed, and in next line transfer fails we will still move on with the transaction and all the states will be updated as the user claimed the token which is actually not true.
## Impact
User will not be able to claim any prize.

## Recommendation
use safeTransfe library from openzeppelin for erc20 transfers.
