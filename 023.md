# FootiumEscrow contract's transferERC20 function is not checking the status of the transfer.

## Summary
The transferERC20 in Footium is calling erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount) to transfer funds to the target account. The success or failure of the transfer is returned as boolean. checking the status is important

## Vulnerability Detail
It is the responsibility of the caller to check the status of boolean to conclude if the transfer is successful or failed. Ignoring the status and continuing means, processing following business logic inspite of a failed transfer. Ignoring could result in miscalculated funds against the tokens moved across accounts.

## Impact
Miscalculated fund, loss of funds from one of the account's point of view. example, Funds did not move in, but the NFT was moves/transfered.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since ERC20 overrides may not return true and that could impact the generic implementation for all ERC20 like in this case.
Recommend to use safeERC20 instead from openzeppelin.
