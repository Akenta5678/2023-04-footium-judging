# Escrow approvals are not cleared when club is transferred allowing for abuse after transfer

## Summary

Escrow approvals remain even across club token transfers. This allows a malicious club owners to sell their club then drain everything after sale due to previous approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC20 and ERC721 token approval persist regardless of the owner of the club. The result is that approvals set by one owner can be accessed after a token has been sold or transferred. This allows the following attack:

1) User A owns clubId = 1
2) User A sets approval to themselves
3) User A sells clubId = 1 to User B
4) User A uses persistent approval to drain all players and tokens

## Impact

Malicious approvals can be used to drain club after sale
