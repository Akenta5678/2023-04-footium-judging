# Unsafe usage of transfer method

## Summary

Unsafe usage of `transfer` method can lead to stuck tokens in the protocol smart contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ERC20 transfer method is called in `claimERC20Prize` and `transferERC20`, but does not check if the returned `bool` value is `true`. This is problematic because there are tokens on the blockchain which actually do not revert on failure but instead return `false` (example is `ZRX`). From the documentation provided we can see that all ERC20 tokens can be used which makes this scenario quite possible.

## Impact

If such a token is used and a transfer fails, the tokens will be stuck in the smart contracts forever ( `FootiumPrizeDistributor` and/or `FootiumEscrow`).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `SafeERC20` library from `OpenZeppelin` and change the `transfer` call to a `safeTransfer` call instead.
