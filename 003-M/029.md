# First twenty players has no generationId assigned / max generation Id assignment does not consider the first minted 20 players

## Summary

First twenty players has no generationId assigned / generation Id assignment does not consider the first minted 20 players

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, first, footiumClub NFT is minted, and meanwhile the first 20 players is minted

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Mint a Footium club and starting squad of players.
 * @dev Only the contract owner can mint.
 * @param to The account to mint to.
 * @param tokenId The club ID to mint.
 */
function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
	footiumClub.safeMint(to, tokenId);

	address escrowAddress = footiumClub.clubToEscrow(tokenId);

	for (uint256 i; i < INITIAL_MINT; ) {
		uint256 playerId = footiumPlayer.safeMint(escrowAddress);
		emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId);

		unchecked {
			i++;
		}
	}
}
```

While in FootiumAcademy, the player is minted and generation Id is assigned

```solidity
if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
	revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}

if (redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]) {
	revert PlayerAlreadyRedeemed(generationId);
}

redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId] = true;

uint256 playerId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
	_footiumClub.clubToEscrow(clubId)
);
```

generationId is important and unique identifer for players, but the first 20 players is missing that.

```solidity
     * @param generationIds The unique identifier of each player within the season cohort.
```

If we see the problom from another point of view

```solidity
if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
	revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}
```

maxGenerationId is used to restrict that the unique generation does not exceed the limit, however, the maxGenerationId does not consider the 20 already minted player, meaning the maxGenerationId (player mint limit is bypassed)

## Impact

First twenty players has no generationId assigned / max generation Id assignment does not consider the first minted 20 players

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol do not mint the player when minting the footiumClub and mint all player using academcy to make the player has generation id assigned.
