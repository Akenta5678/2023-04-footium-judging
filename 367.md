# Unclaimed Rewards Can Be Lost When Merkle Root is Changed

## Summary
Unclaimed Rewards Can Be Lost When Merkle Root is Changed

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is present in a FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol contract that allows users to claim rewards using Merkle tree verification. The contract has a function named `setERC20MerkleRoot` and `setETHMerkleRoot`, which is intended to update the Merkle root used for verifying rewards. However, if a user fails to claim their reward before the Merkle root is changed, they will lose their reward.

## Impact
Unclaimed Rewards Can Be Lost When Merkle Root is Changed

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function setERC20MerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {
        erc20MerkleRoot = _merkleRoot;

        emit SetERC20MerkleRoot(erc20MerkleRoot);
    }
```

```solidity
function setETHMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {
        ethMerkleRoot = _merkleRoot;

        emit SetETHMerkleRoot(ethMerkleRoot);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, the smart contract owner should implement a mechanism to allow users to claim their rewards even after the Merkle root has been changed. This can be done by adding a time limit for users to claim their rewards or by implementing a fallback mechanism to allow users to claim their rewards using the previous Merkle root.

Alternatively, the smart contract can be designed to automatically transfer any unclaimed rewards to a designated address before the Merkle root is changed
