# [DOS] Attacker can render mintPlayers() function in FootiumAcademy.sol  inoperateable

## Summary
Attacker can make mintPlayers() inoperateable.
## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can mint players via the mintPlayers() function not just the owner.
But according to the devs here
```solidity
     * @dev Only the owner can mint players to their club.
```
only the owner should be able to mint players to their club.

## Impact
This will cause inefficiencies for the owner as a malicious actor can maliciously mintPlayers() in a way that will negatively affect the owner, his club and this FootiumAcademy.sol contract

For example a malicious actor can do these:

- call the mintPlayers() function and mint an enormous amount of players to the point the _validateMintingParams() function begins to revert because of this `IF` statement here
```solidity
        if (msg.value < totalFee) {
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
```
this happens because totalFee is derived from ` playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier];` so he can mint players in such a way that `msg.value will always be < totalFee`

hereby rendering the mintPlayers() inoperateable because there's no function to delete or burn players in `FootiumAcademy.sol`

The owner should have sole control over the creation of his players.
