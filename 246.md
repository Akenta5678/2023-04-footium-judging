# ETH funds transferred to FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol cannot be removed due to missing owner-controlled withdraw function

## Summary

The `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` contract accumulates the ETH that is earned through the minting of players via the `FootiumAcademy.sol` contract. But a function that allows withdrawing of these ETH earnings for the Footium project is missing which keeps these ETH funds stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `FootiumAcademy.sol` contract players can be minted by calling the `mintPlayers` function: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/317770a4cb2e23734a88a4fc8c272c018e1c1a85/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166.

ETH needs to be paid (`totalFee`) to cover the minting fees the project charges for player mints which is then transferred into the contract which is set in the `_prizeDistributorAddress` state variable in `FootiumAcademy.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/317770a4cb2e23734a88a4fc8c272c018e1c1a85/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L208

The naming of the variable strongly hints that this contract ETH is transferred to is `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol`.

But unlike other contracts in the audit scope `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` does not have a withdraw function for the contract ETH balance. E.g. `FootiumAcademy.sol` has such a function that can be called by the contract owner only: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/317770a4cb2e23734a88a4fc8c272c018e1c1a85/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L218

It is assumed that the ETH earnings of the Footium project gained through minting of players and transferred into `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` will largely exceed the ETH that is claimed through the `claimETHPrize` function of `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` by users.

The Footium Project would need to "hack the game mechanics" to extract ETH via the `claimETHPrize` function for them. 

They would first need to inject a manipulated merkle tree that includes the required claimable amount for them by calling the `setETHMerkleRoot` function in `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L79

They would then need to claim that ETH price by calling the `claimETHPrize`  in `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L144

This recovery strategy would only work if the `msg.sender` claiming the ETH prize is an EOA (externally owned account) or a smart contract that can receive ETH (has a receive function of payable fallback function).

## Impact

Funds earned for the Footium project through player minting are stuck.

## Recommendation

To withdraw the ETH funds from `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` the contract should be extended by an owner-controlled withdraw function:

```Solidity
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```
