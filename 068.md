# keccak256 - abi.encodePacked Allows Hash Collision

Medium

## Summary

`abi.encodePacked` Allows Hash Collision

From the solidity documentation:
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html?highlight=collisions#non-standard-packed-mode
If you use `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b))` and both `a` and `b` are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of `a` into `b` and vice-versa. More specifically, `abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c")`.

This issue exists in the FootiumAcademy contract in the `_validateMintingParams` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the solidity docs describe, two or more dynamic types are passed to abi.encodePacked. Moreover, these dynamic values are user-specified function arguments in external functions, meaning anyone can directly specify the value of these arguments when calling the function.

`keccak256(abi.encodePacked(clubId, divisionTier))` takes in two `uint256` params which can intentionally or accidentally produce a hash collision which could bypass the check  `MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify`

## Impact

Since in line 245 there is a check to make sure that only the owner of the club can call the function, the potential impact of the hash collision is severely reduced. 

However, since a user can own multiple  `clubId` which each their `divisionTier`, it is possible for a hash collision to pass through the owner check and influence the calculation of the `totalFee`.
