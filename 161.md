# Excess Ethereum Payment Vulnerability in FootiumAcademy.sol

## Summary
This vulnerability relates to the FootiumAcademy.sol smart contract where players are minted by users. When minting a player, the contract requires the user to pay an amount of Ethereum equal to `playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier]`. However, if a user accidentally sends more Ethereum than the required amount, the contract does not return the excess funds. This could result in a loss of funds for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is present in the FootiumAcademy.sol smart contract and arises during the player minting process. The contract calculates the required Ethereum payment as `playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier]`. However, the contract does not check if the user has sent excess Ethereum and does not return the excess funds to the user. As a result, if a user sends more Ethereum than the required amount, the contract will keep the excess Ethereum without any refund to the user.

Note that divisionToFee is an array that maps a divisionTier to a fee multiplier, which can be set by the admin at any time. If the fee multiplier is decreased, users could accidentally overpay for their player minting.

## Impact
If this vulnerability is exploited, users who accidentally send more Ethereum than the required amount will lose their excess funds. As a result, they may be discouraged from using the FootiumAcademy platform in the future. This could also result in reputation damage for the platform.

It is important to note that the divisionToFee array can be updated at any time by the admin. If the fee multiplier is decreased, users who minted players before the update may have overpaid for their player minting, resulting in a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend implementing a refund function that returns excess Ethereum sent by users during the player minting process. This function should be triggered if the user sends more Ethereum than the required amount.
