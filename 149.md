# Unsafe ERC20.transfer() - unchecked return values

## Summary
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. 

Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead. (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code))
## Vulnerability Detail
The unsafe `.transfer()` function is used in the `claimERC20Prize` function in the FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol contract.
```solidity
    function claimERC20Prize(/*parameters*/) 
external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
     //validations
        
        uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];

        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }

        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
    }
``` 
Implemented that way, there's a risk of a silent transfer failure which would lead to the internal balance of `totalERC20Claimed` being updated as the user supposedly received his tokens while in fact, he didn't receive anything.

This will lead to his tokens being stuck in the contract.
## Impact
Could lead to stuck user funds in the contract, if a reward token that doesn't revert on failure but returns `false` instead is used.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
