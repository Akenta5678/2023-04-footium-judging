# Tokens will be locked

## Summary
The `transferERC20()` is using `transfer()` 

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to the function is using `tranfer()` , if sending tokens to a wrong address or an incompatible recipient contract, the tokens might become "locked" or irretrievable.

safeTransfer checks whether it implements the onERC20Received function, as required by the ERC20 standard. If the recipient contract does not implement this function, the safeTransfer will revert, preventing the tokens from being locked in an incompatible contract.

## Impact
Tokens will be locked

## Recommendation
use `safeTransfer()` instead of the basic `transfer()` function when dealing with ERC20 token transfers.
