# FootiumPrizeDistributor doesn't have a withdraw function

## Summary
FootiumPrizeDistributor doesn't have a withdraw function which makes it possible for funds to be stuck in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumPrizeDistributor  has a [`receive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L53-L55) function. The eth send to this is used to pay out the prizes to the players. However if too much eth is send to the receive function, there is no way to withdraw the excess eth.
## Impact
If for example game ends or a lot of eth is send to the contract. And not everything is send out in prizes to the players, the eth will be stuck in the contract forever.

A withdraw function should be added like in the other contracts.
