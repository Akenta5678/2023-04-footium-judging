# 11 players can be minted when starting from index 0

## Summary
You can mint 11 player when minting players with the [`mintPlayers`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166-L212) function in FootiumAcademy if you start with id 0.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function checks if generationId is higher then max amount of players that can be minted. Which default will be 10. However if the array parameter `generationIds` is index 0 to 10, these are 11 players.
```solidity
if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) { 
   revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
}
```
As you can see in this test, it's possible to mint 11 players when the _maxGenerationId is 10
```solidity
        it.only("should mint 11 players", async () => {
            const divisionTier = 4;
            const generationIds = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9 ,10 ];
            const ethAmount = ethers.BigNumber.from(divisionFees[divisionTier - 1]).mul(generationIds.length);
            await academy.connect(addr1).mintPlayers(1,7,divisionTier,generationIds,clubDivProof,{value: ethAmount,});

            let escrowAddrclub7 = await clubs.clubToEscrow(7);

            expect(await players.balanceOf(escrowAddrclub7)).to.equal(11);
        });
```
In the provided tests, players are also minted starting with index 0.
## Impact
This means gamers can per cohort mint 1 more player than specified.

## Recommendation
Instead of uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; make it <=
