# ERC20 stolen by approve front run

## Summary
By monitoring the updating of approve and withdrawing it just before it is to be updated, the asset can be stolen.

## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumEscrow`'s `setApprovalForERC20` calls `erc20Contract.approve(to, amount)`.
For example, assume that the spender initially received an approval of 40 tokens.
In this situation, ClubOwner tries to change it to an approve of 60 tokens.
The spender (to) monitors this call and frontrun the transaction to spend 40 before making the change.
This gives the spender a total of 100 tokens, even though the owner only attempted to change to a 60 token approve.
## Impact
spender steals escrow assets.
