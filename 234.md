# Footium clubs may be minted to non ERC721 receivers

## Summary

Footium uses ERC721 safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom throughout the codebase. This ensures that ERC721 tokens are not transferred to non ERC721 receivers. However, the initial Footium club mint in safeMint uses `_mint` rather than `_safeMint` and does not check that the receiver accepts ERC721 token transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail

Addresses that are sent a Footium club, but don't contain ERC721 receivers will have their Footium club frozen in the contract. See comments from openZeppelin discouraging the use of `_mint`.

## Impact

Users will lose their Footium club NFT. This vulnerability is marked as high because footium club NFT's play a critical role in the operation of Footium's gaming ecosystem.
