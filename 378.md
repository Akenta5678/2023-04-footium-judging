# Buyers of Footium Clubs on secondary markets can get rekt

## Summary

See vulnerability detail

## Vulnerability Detail

From the docs, there can be legendary `FootiumPlayers`, thus is expected these players will be more valuable than the normal ones. Therefor Clubs ids who owns these players are expected to be more valuable. 

It is possible for a club owner, whose club owns a legendary player, to sell the club nft via secondary markets. This owner can take advantage of a buyer by transferring out the legendary player before the buyer tx gets confirmed.

## Impact

Buyer will pay for a club which has a legendary player, but wont get the player.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a timelock to the transfer of nfts on the `FootiumEscrow` contract with a `startTime` and `deadline`. 

`startTime` ensures that the club owner cannot execute the nft transfer immediately.
`deadline` ensures that the club owner cannot wait until he can take advantage of the transfer
