# Escrow allows the owner to be smart contract wallet but doesn't allow signing messages

## Summary
FootiumEscrow's owner can be set to a smart contract wallet, but it will not allow it to sign messages since `isValidSignature` implements only ECDSA signature check

## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumEscrow is a in-game wallet that allows club owners to manage their players. FootiumEscrow contract is IERC1271 compliant and has `isValidSignature`, but it only implements ECDSA signature. FootiumClub NFT can be minted and transferred to a smart contract wallet. Many popular smart contract wallets implement their own cryptography for signature validation that is different from ECDSA, e.g. [Safe (previously Gnosis Safe)](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-protocol/signatures), [Etherspot](https://etherspot.io/), [Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/), [Soul Wallet](https://www.soulwallet.io/) and many many more

## Impact
Supporting only ECDSA will prevent most of the smart contract wallets from managing their Escrow contract and, if FootiumClub NFT is minted to a smart contract wallet, the wallet will be forced to transfer the ownership to a EOA contract

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L53-L66
```solidity
function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature)
  external
  view
  returns (bytes4 magicValue)
{
  if (
    ECDSA.recover(hash, signature) ==
    IERC721(footiumClubAddress).ownerOf(clubId)
  ) {
    return MAGICVALUE;
  }

  return 0xffffffff;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SignatureChecker in `FootiumEscrow.isValidSignature` - https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/SignatureChecker.sol

If Escrow's owner is a smart contract wallet `SignatureChecker` will call it's `isValidSignature` which is a correct way to handle signatures

```solidity
function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature)
  external
  view
  returns (bytes4 magicValue)
{
  address owner = IERC721(footiumClubAddress).ownerOf(clubId);
  if (SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow(owner, hash, signature)) {
    return MAGICVALUE;
  }
  return 0xffffffff;
}
```
