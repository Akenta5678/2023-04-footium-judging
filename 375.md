# transferERC721 does not work as intended

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L125

## Vulnerability Detail
The `FootiumEscrow` contract uses  OpenZepplinâ€™s `safeTransferFrom` function. This function as stipulated by OpenZepplin specifies that:

`If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.`

`safeTransferFrom` uses `address(this)` as the from value. Since the contract address does not equal the msg.sender, the contract address has to have approved the msg.sender. 

There are two ways to do approvals in the contract: `setApprovalForERC20` and `setApprovalForERC721` . Note that both of these functions have the `onlyClubOwner` thus cannot be called by the contract to approve the owner as a spender. 

Thus when we try to transfer out the token, since the contract has not approved owner as a spender it will revert.

## Impact
NFT tokens cannot be transferred out

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove onlyClubOwner modifier from approvals and instead add a require statement that verifies caller is either club owner or contract itself.
