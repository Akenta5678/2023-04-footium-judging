# Use a safe transfer helper library for ERC20 transfers

## Summary
The [FootiumPrizeDistributor#claimERC20Prize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L106-L134) function executes an ERC20 transfer using the `transfer()` function instead of the `safeTransfer()` function and there is no check to validate that the transfer was successful or not.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are two issues with using `transfer()` directly:

1. `FootiumPrizeDistributor#claimERC20Prize()` function does not check the return value of this call. Tokens that return false rather than revert to indicate failed transfers may silently fail rather than revert as expected.

2. Since the IERC20 interface requires a boolean return value, attempting to transfer ERC20s with [missing return values](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#missing-return-values) will revert. This means FootiumPrizeDistributor cannot support a number of popular ERC20s, including USDT and BNB.

## Impact
If the transfer() of the _token doesn't revert on failure but instead it returns false, the execution won't detect the failure and the call to transfer() will be considered as successful, as a result, the `totalERC20Claimed` variable will be updated as if the user actually received the rewards, when in reality it didn't!

## Recommendation
Use a safe transfer library like OpenZeppelin [SafeERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20) to ensure consistent handling of ERC20 return values and abstract over [inconsistent ERC20 implementations](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20)
