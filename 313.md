# FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol - claimERC20Prize: return value of transfer function not checked

## Summary
The transfer of ERC20 token can fail without revert, this result can be given back as a boolean return value. It is not checked in the claimERC20Prize function when the token are transferred to the claiming user, and a failed transfer is not detected and users do not get their prize token.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the audit Q&A the protocol is expected to interact with ANY ERC20 token. Not all token do a revert itself when a transfer failed for whatever reason. Some give back the result of the transfer in a boolean return value. The ERC20 standard is not well defined here, so this case should always be taken into account and the return value should be always checked, and the transaction reverted (or the claiming not counted) if the transfer failed.

## Impact
Users cannot be able to claim their prize, if the transfer of the token fails and the token in question is a ERC20 token that does not revert itself in this case. Furthermore, the users then lose their prize, as it is recorded in the smart contract as already claimed. 

## Code Snippet
FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:
```solidity
        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the return value of the transfer function and revert the transaction on a failed transfer.
