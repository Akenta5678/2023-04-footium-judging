# Second preimage attack on Merkle divisionProof

## Summary

The Merkle Tree used to encode the club -> division tier can _potentially_ be manipulated, resulting in the potentially on zero-fee player minting for a given.``(seasonId, clubId, divisionTier)`` triple.

## Vulnerability Detail

The key issue is that the leaf hash in the division Merkle Tree is the ``keccak256`` hash of two ``byte32`` elements (see [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L239) line), which is the same way the hashes of the internal Merkle tree nodes are computed. So, an attacker can *prove* that some other ``(clubId, divisionTier)`` pair is actually in the tree. 

The attacker would select two sibling nodes internal nodes anywhere in the tree (not necessarily leaves) and pass them as ``clubId`` and ``divisionTier``, and generate a corresponding Merkle proof. The Merkle tree check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L239) would gladly accept that value.

In general, ``divisionTier`` would be random value, so ``divisionToFee[divisionTier]`` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L258) would return 0. Now, the ``clubId`` is also a random value (where the attacker has no control over), so _in most cases_ the check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L245) would fail. 

However, if the attacker has any influence over the ``tokenId`` used when a new Club is minted [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L68). Then, this becomes a very real threat. 

Note that this exact Merkle tree limitation / flaw is directly called out on the OpenZeppelin Merkle tree [documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#MerkleProof). 
 
## Impact

The attacker can _potentially_ mint players with zero fees. But it requires them to have some influence / control over the Club ``tokenId``, or finds some direct collision (which is unlikely).

## Recommendation
Use the leaf encoding recommended [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree#leaf-hash).
