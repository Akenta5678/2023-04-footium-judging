# Return of arbitrary ERC20 transfer is not checked in escrow

## Summary
The return value of erc20.transfer call in `transferERC20()` is not checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

Several tokens do not revert in case of transfer failure and return `false` instead. If one of these tokens is used here, although transfer fails, `transferERC20()` will not revert. Moreover, the return value is not returned to the caller, which makes it impossible to handle this issue in case it is called by another contract that expects a successful transfer.

## Impact
Depending on where the function is called from, the impact can be quite severe.

## Recommendation

Require the return value of the transfer to be `true` or use OZ's `SafeERC20` wrapper for ERC20 tokens.
