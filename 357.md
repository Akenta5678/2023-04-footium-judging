# After first claim, claimERC20Prize and claimETHPrize does not claim the full amount anymore

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In FootiumPrizeDistributor#claimERC20Prize, the totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] mapping stores the total amount of erc20 claimed from the club owner. Let's say a club owner intends to claim 100 ERC20 tokens.

```solidity
        uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];


        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }
```

value = 100 tokens - 0 (no tokens claimed yet) = 100
Since value > 0, totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] = 100

Later on, there's another 90 tokens of prize to be claimed.
value = 90 - 100 (revert due to underflow)

The club owner must wait until >100 tokens can be claimed before calling claim. 

Now, the club owner waits until the prize to be claimed is 110.
value = 110 - 100 = 10
since value > 0, totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] = 110

Club owner only claims 10 instead of 110 tokens. There is 100 tokens left to claim but the club owner cannot claim because 100 <  totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]

## Impact

Club owner cannot claim the full amount.
