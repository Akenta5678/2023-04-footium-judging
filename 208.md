# Unable to claim ETH prize if msg.sender address is locked on merkle tree being a smart contract that cannot receive ETH

## Summary

The `claimETHPrize` function in `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` requires the `msg.sender` to be the `_to` parameter passed to the function and to be contained in the merkle tree to validate the eligibility for the ETC prize.

This enforces that only the account tracked on the merkle tree can claim the prize. But if this account is a smart contract that cannot receive ETH the prize can never be claimed as the ETH transfer would fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L149 it is enforced that the `_to` parameter is the `msg.sender`.

The `_to` parameter is further used to validate the eligibility for claiming the ETC prize in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L157.

No additional parameter in the signature of the `claimETHPrize` function exist to redirect payout of the ETH prize to. It is enforced to only be sent to `_to`.

Because of the aformentioned claiming the ETH prize is impossible in a situation where the `msg.sender / _to` is a smart contract that cannot receive ETH (no receive or payable callback function implemented). This leads to the ETH stuck in the contract and the user unable to claim it.

## Impact

Claiming the ETH prize is impossible in situations where a claim is documented on the merkle tree for an account that is a smart contract that cannot receive ETH. This leads to ETH stuck in the contract and the user unable to claim it.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `claimETHPrize` function like shown below to use `msg.sender` for tracking the ETH prize claims and use the `_to` allowing the caller to send the claimed ETH to an address of his choice. This would have the positive side effect that claimed ETH can directly be sent to another account (e.g. to cold storage) saving transfer fees for an additional transfer after climing the ETH prize.

```Solidity
function claimETHPrize(
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {

    if (
        !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
            _proof,
            ethMerkleRoot,
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _amount))
        )
    ) {
        revert InvalidETHMerkleProof();
    }

    uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[msg.sender];

    if (value > 0) {
        totalETHClaimed[msg.sender] += value;

        (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(value);
        }
    }

    emit ClaimETH(_to, value);
}

```

Maybe the ClaimETH event would need to be extended by an additional parameter to track the claiming account and the address the ETH was transferred to.

```Solidity
event ClaimETH(address indexed claimer, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

Then the claimETHPrice function would need to be adapted like this:

```Solidity
emit ClaimETH(msg.sender, _to, value);
```
