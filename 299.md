# Bad club owner can set approval for all to himself, sell the club and take all players

## Summary
A club owner can `setApprovalForERC721` to his own address, sell the club and take all players even though he is no longer the owner

## Vulnerability Detail

When buying a club NFT and the corresponding escrow contract a user normally does not check if any approvals for spending ERC721 tokens are set. This means that a club owner can `setApprovalForERC721` to his own address, sell the club and still have access to all player NFTs. Once he sold the club, he can send the player NFTs of the club’s escrow account to himself and sell them separately on a market place.

## Impact
The new owner loses all the players of his new club and will need to spend additional money to revoke the approval for the old owner if he wants to continue to use the club NFT or sell a “save” club NFT.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a tool in the front end that warns new owners if the escrow account of a club has approved anyone to spend any ERC721 tokens. An array of addresses that got approved could be used for tracking and a public function could be used to check how many accounts still have approval for all.
