# Same player ID can be minted multiple times

## Summary

Same player ID can be minted multiple times.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/technical-docs/FootiumAcademy.md#mintplayersseasonid-seasonid-uint256-clubid-uint256-divid-uint256-calldata-generationids-bytes32-calldata-divproof-external-payable-whennotpaused-nonreentrant) of `FootiumAcademy`'s `mintPlayers` function it says that `a player ID cannot be minted twice`.

However, the same player ID can be used in the same cohort by different clubs, as it is checked whether the `generationId` has been used for a specific club.

```solidity
File: FootiumAcademy.sol

194         redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId] = true;
```
