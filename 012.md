# FootiumClub's safeMint can lead to losing the minted token

## Summary
FootiumClub contract has a function to mint new "club" ERC721 tokens called `safeMint`. But that function is using internally `_mint()` instead of `_safeMint()` for ERC721.

## Vulnerability Detail
When minting a new "club" ERC721 token using the contract's safeMint() function, it will call the ERC721 `_mint()` function. However, if the `to` address is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721: 
> "A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers."

As per the documentation of ERC721.sol by OpenZeppelin:

## Impact
Users possibly lose their NFTs.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `_safeMint` instead of `_mint` to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
