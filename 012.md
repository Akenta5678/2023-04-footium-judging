# underflow/overflow in the claimERC20Price() function found in FootiumPriceDistributor.sol

## Summary
underflow/overflow is possible if `_amount` is a number smaller than `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]`

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say a user wants to claim a smaller amount from his total erc20 tokens claimed.
lets say:

- the user uses 10 as `_amount` while his `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]` is 1000
 
- now according to this line  [`uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L126)

this is what we'll have -- `value = 10 - 1000`. which is a negative number i.e -990.

## Impact
`value` will underflow/overflow and wrong value will be transferred to the user (it can either be bigger than its supposed to be or smaller than its supposed to be)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
subtract `_amount` from `totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to]` instead
```solidity
        uint256 value = totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] - _amount;
```
