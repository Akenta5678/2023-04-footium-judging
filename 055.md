# With an ERC20 token with No Revert on Failure, the token is recognized as withdrawn even though it has not been withdrawn.

## Summary
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return `false` (e.g. ZRX).
If the implementation does not check the return value, processing proceeds as if the transfer succeeded even though it failed.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `FootiumPrizeDistributor`'s `claimERC20Prize`, the token is transferred with `_token.transfer(_to, value)`. However. This does not check the return value, so even if it fails, the process proceeds as if it had succeeded.
## Impact
The user does not receive the token but is recorded as having received it. It is a substantial loss of funds.
