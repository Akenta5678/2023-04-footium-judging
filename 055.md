# Unsafe use approve ERC20

# [M01] Use of unsafe approve ERC20

## Summary
It is recommended to reduce the spender allowance to zero before each approve(<SPENDER>, <AMOUNT>) call.

## Vulnerability Detail
IERC20.approve() function is called without setting the allowance to zero. Some tokens, like USDT, require first reducing the address' allowance to zero by calling approve(_spender, 0).

## Impact
Some tokens, like USDT, require first reducing the address' allowance to zero by calling approve(_spender, 0). Transactions will revert when using an unsupported token like USDT

```solidity
    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,

        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
