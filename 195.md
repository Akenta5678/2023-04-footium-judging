# Escrow contract approvals are not cleared on club transfer

## Summary
The club owner can approve 3rd-party addresses to transfer both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens from the club's escrow. When the club NFT is transferred to another address, these approvals are not zeroed so the previous owner can still have access to the club's escrow even after transferring the club NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail

On a new club mint, the Escrow contract is deployed and bound to the club tokenId:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L62-L63

Then, the player NFTs are minted and transferred to this Escrow:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L69-L80 

`FootiumEscrow` contract allows the club owner to approve 3rd-party addresses to transfer arbitrary ERC20 or ERC721 tokens on behalf of this escrow:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L75-L96

At the same time, there's no approvals resetting on the club NFT transfer. The `FootiumClub` contract overrides neither the default ERC721 `safeTransfer` nor the `safeTransferFrom` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol

## Impact
A malicious club owner can first approve themself to transfer club players (or any other ERC721/ERC20 tokens) on behalf of the Escrow contract, then sell the club, and then withdraw all the tokens from the Escrow contract.

## Recommendation
Since there's an ability to set an approval for **arbitrary** ERC20/ERC721 tokens, you should:
1. Store every token address, the approval was set for, within the `FootiumEscrow` contract's storage.
2. Implement the `resetApprovals` function within the `FootiumEscrow` contract that would zero every previously made approval
3. Override the `safeTransfer` ERC721 function in the `FootiumClub` in order to call the `resetApprovals` function of the corresponding Escrow
