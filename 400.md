# Risk of loosing tokens after burning the NFT Club

## If a NFT Club is burned, the players and tokens can be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a new club is minted, it implements it's own `safeMint` function which instatiates a new escrow:
```solidity
function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)  external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) nonReentrant  whenNotPaused {
...
FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
...
```
[FootiumClub.sol#L56](`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L56`)

The escrow is responsible to store players and tokens. However a club can be burned, as it was on the mock `FootiumPlayerMockV2.sol`:
```solidity
function burn(uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
        ++numOfBurnedTokens;
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```
[FootiumPlayerMockV2.sol#L81](`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/mocks/FootiumPlayerMockV2.sol#L81`)
When that happens, the escrow is lost, since it was instanciated as per NFT for each `tokenId`. But the escrow is the where players and tokens are stored. Therefore, tokens will be lost after burning a NFT Club.

## Impact
Risk of loosing players and tokens after if the NFT Club is burned.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a `burn` function like it was done with `safeMint` and before calling OZ internal function `_burn`, transfer remaining tokens and players to the protocol or to a new club.
