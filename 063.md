# Escrow ERC-20 token approvals allow for double spend

## Summary
Naively changing an ERC-20 token allowance using the `FootiumEscrow.setApprovalForERC20` function allows for a double spend attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setApprovalForERC20` function simply wraps the standard ERC 20 `approve` function. 

```solidity
function setApprovalForERC20(IERC20 erc20Contract, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyClubOwner {
    erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
}
```

Using the standard ERC-20 `approve` function to change an allowance from one non-zero amount to another non-zero amount allows for a double spend attack. This is because the approved address can sandwich the approval to spend both the old and new amounts.

## Impact
Approved ERC-20 token allowance can be double spent.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions that operate on the current allowance. This would be similar to the `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions in the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation.
