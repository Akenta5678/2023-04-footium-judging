# Footium clubs can be minted to contracts that do not support ERC-721

## Summary
The 'FootiumClub' contract does not use `_safeMint` to mint clubs. This means that clubs can be minted to contracts that do not support ERC-721, which would likely cause the club NFT to become locked in the receiving contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `FootiumClub` contract defines an external `safeMint` function allowing addresses with the `MINTER_ROLE` to mint clubs. However, this function uses `_mint` instead of `_safeMint` to mint clubs.

```solidity
function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
    clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

    _mint(to, tokenId);

    emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
}
```

`_mint` does not check whether recipient contracts support by calling `onERC721Received` on the recipient contract. 

## Impact
Club NFTs will likely become locked in contracts that do not support ERC-721.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `_safeMint` instead of `_mint` to mint clubs.

```diff
function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
    clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

-   _mint(to, tokenId);
+   _safeMint(to, tokenId);

    emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
}
```
