# A club with a crafted id can be used to mint free players from the academy

## Summary
If a club is minted with a specific id, the owner of this club can mint players for free.

## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumClubMinter has a method mint():
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L68-L82

Which only allows the owner to mint, but on an arbitrary id. Since the club id is used in the FootiumAcademy mint validation:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L235-L243

If the club id matches a left intermediary node of the merkle tree, it is possible to make a proof where divisionTier would be equal to the right intermediary node of the merkle tree. 

The merkle tree intermediary nodes are just concatenated and hashed during verification, and since they are also of size bytes32/uint256 this type of collision is possible because the leaf of the tree is of the same form in this case (uint256, uint256) as the internal nodes.

The minted players would be free because 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L258

if the divisionTier key is not in the mapping, it would yield a zero value for the fee.

## Impact
It is possible to create a club with an id allowing it to mint free players. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability is already very unlikely unless the platform allows the user to choose an arbitrary id for the minted club id, but adding a range-check in divisionTiers would make sure it is completely inexploitable.
