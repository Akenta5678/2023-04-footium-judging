# Some user prizes may be stuck in FootiumPrizeDistributor

## Summary
When there are several leaves in the MerkleTree belonging to one userAddress, he will not be able to claim all the prizes belonging to him. Leaving this prizes stuck in FootiumPrizeDistributor. These belongs to either ERC20 and ETH prizes

## Vulnerability Detail
There is mapping totalETHClaimed (receiver -> ethAmountReceived), that breaks the logic of multiple leaves with same recepient in the Merkle tree.
```solidity
    function claimETHPrize(
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        //... skip proof checks

        //@audit if 2 proofs per recipient, it will break
        uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];

        if (value > 0) {
            totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;

            (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(value);
            }
        }

        emit ClaimETH(_to, value);
    }
```
Suppose Merkle tree has multiple leaves, but there are 2 following:
1)Alice receiver, 3 ether
2)Alice receiver, 5 ether

So Alice claims 5 ether -----> totalETHClaimed[Alice] = 5 ether
When Alice tries to claim 3 ether, it will revert due to underflow:
```solidity
        uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];
```
Because uint256 value = 3 ether - 5 ether;

And similar flow in `claimERC20Prize()`

## Impact
User is unable to claim all of his rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep track of claimed amounts in different way. And don't use duplicate values in MerkleTree (like (Alice, 3 ether) and (Alice, 3 ether))
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) totalETHClaimed
mapping(IERC20Upgradeable => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool))) totalERC20Claimed;
```
