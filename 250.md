# Not using safeERC20 operations might cause users losing funds on the FootiumPrizeDistributor contract

## Summary

The `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` contract has a function `claimERC20Prize`, this is used by whitelisted users to claim their season prizes.

## Vulnerability Detail

Given the following context:

`_token` is an ERC20 token which returns False instead of reverting execution
`_token.balanceOf(FootiumPrizeDistributor) == 0`. Is not necessary the _token's balance of the contract to be zero, any balance that is smaller than the `_amount` to be claimed will trigger the vulnerability.

Then a user calls the function `claimERC20Prize()` function. Because the contract does not have the enough balance to make the transfer, the call will return false, but the mapping `totalERC20Claimed` will still be updated as if the user have received the tokens.

It can be argued that the owner can update the `erc20MerkleRoot`, but this will still cause a wrong accounting of tokens claimed by the user, leading to unsafe integrations with external contracts.

## Impact

Due to not using a `safeERC20` library, in certain conditions users might lose their prizes.
