# FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol - Unsecured receive() function with stuck funds

## Summary
The contract implements the payable receive() function and allows anyone to send funds in the contract. There is no bookkeeping to record which amount was sent in by whom. There is no mechanism implemented to extract the funds, neither for the uses, nor for the admins (outside of the claimable amount). Therefore the funds can get stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail
I was not able to determine exactly where the receive() function is in the Footium application, and for what and by which sources it is used. However, if some user sends funds into this contract (for example by accident), then there is no way to extract the funds back, as there is no such function implemented, and also it is not recorded which user sends in which amount.

Additionally, if at some later point, the balance of the contract is used for further calculations (in the whole Footium app ecosystem), and the balance is expected to be some well defined, meaningful amount, the application logic behind the calculation can be manipulated by sending funds into the contract.

## Impact
Funds can get stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet

FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol:
```solidity
53: receive() external payable {
54:    emit ETHReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);
55:}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The receive() function should check if the incoming transaction is coming from an expected sender address, and revert if not. If this is not possible, or the function should be available to anyone, then a way to transfer the funds back to the sender should be implemented, so that users can get their funds back, if it was sent by accident.
