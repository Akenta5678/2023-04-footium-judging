# Attacker can front run approval

## Summary
Race condition exists in the `setApprovalForERC20()` function, which allows someone to front-run the transaction when the club owner grants approval to someone with the intention of changing the amount approved. The recipient of the approval can consume the previous approval and then consume the new approval amount.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `setApprovalForERC20()` function is used to set approval for `ERC20` tokens. This function can be called by the club owner to grant approval to another address to spend a certain amount of tokens. The issue here is that there is a race condition, where if the club owner grants approval to another address with the intention of changing the amount approved, the recipient of the approval can front-run the transaction. This means that the recipient of the approval can consume the previous approval and then consume the new approval amount when the club owner's transaction goes through. This race condition can lead to potential loss of funds.

Consider the following Alice-Bob scenario:

Alice is the owner of an `ERC20` token.
Alice wants to grant Bob approval to spend 100 tokens using the `setApprovalForERC20()` function.
Bob, who is a miner, notices this transaction and quickly creates his own transaction to consume the 100 tokens that Alice has approved him to spend.
Bob's transaction is executed before Alice's transaction, which leads to Bob consuming the 100 tokens that Alice approved him to spend.
When Alice's transaction goes through, Bob has already consumed the 100 tokens and can now consume any new tokens that Alice approves him to spend.

## Impact
The vulnerability impacts the club owner and the recipient of the approval. If the club owner grants approval to the recipient with the intention of changing the amount approved, the recipient can consume the previous approval and then consume the new approval amount when the club owner's transaction goes through. This can lead to potential loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the race condition vulnerability in `setApprovalForERC20` function, consider implementing an `increaseApproval` function that increments the approved amount and a `decreaseApproval` function that decrements the approved amount. Additionally, the approve function should be used only when granting initial approval.
