# Approve and transferFrom functions of ERC20 tokens are subject to front-run attack

## Summary

`Approve` and `transferFrom` functions of ERC20 tokens are generally subject to front-run attack because the `approve` function **overwrites** the current allowance regardless of whether the spender has already used it or not.

In case the spender has spent the amount already, the `approve` function will approve a new amount which allows the spender to also spend the newly approved amount.

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L80 the `approve` function is used which leads to exposure to this front-run attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is a well know vulnerability around the usage of **approve** with ERC20 tokens.

An example for clarification:

- Alice grants permission to Bob to transfer a specific amount (N>0) of Alice's tokens by using the `approve` function and passing Bob's address and N as the arguments.

- At a later point, Alice decides to change the number of tokens Bob is allowed to transfer to a new value (M>0), and calls the `approve` function **again** with Bob's address and M as the arguments.

- Bob notices the second transaction before it is confirmed (by observing the mempool) and promptly sends a transferFrom transaction to move N of Alice's tokens to another account.

- If Bob's `transferFrom` transaction is confirmed before Alice's second approval transaction (Bob ensures this by spending more gas than Alice does for her transaction changing the approval), Bob will successfully transfer N tokens and gain permission to transfer an additional M tokens.

- This allows Bob to transfer N+M tokens, even though Alice never intended to allow Bob to transfer such a large amount. Alice just wanted bob to transfer M tokens.

## Impact

It can result in losing tokens for the approving user when he approves tokens to any malicious account.

## Recommendation

Use the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation to set approvals via the contained `increaseAllowance` (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L177) and `decreaseAllowance` (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L197) functions.
