# erc20 and eth prize can be drained from `FootiumPrizeDistributor` due to abi.encodePacked hash collision

## Summary
In `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contract any malicious user can claim erc20 prize or eth prize even when not whitelisted in the merkle tree.
## Vulnerability Detail
From the solidity documentation:
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html?highlight=collisions#non-standard-packed-mode
> If you use keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b)) and both a and b are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of a into b and vice-versa. More specifically, abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c").

And both `claimERC20Prize` function and `claimETHPrize` function we are using the user specified dynamic types and in `claimERC20Prize` function there are 3 dynamic arguments that are `token`, `to` and `amount`.

So a malicious user can easily construct a hash using `to` and `amount` that passes the following merkle check and get away with partial or whole amount of wallet

Such attack may not be possible in `FootiumAcademy` contract cause clubid is not user controlled.

So 
## Impact
Partial or whole balance from the contract can be drained.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use abi.encode instead of packed encoding.
