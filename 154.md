# Excess ETH can be sent to Academy when minting players

## Summary
When clubs mints players in Academy they are sending the fee associated with it aswell (number of players * divisionTier). Code only checks whether the msg.value > fee, if there is an excess ETH sent to contract it will be donated to contract instead of refund to user.
## Vulnerability Detail
Sending ETH with a greater value on msg.value than the actual fee will result the excess ETH sent to be stayed in the contract. If users are not careful enough their ETH can be donated to contract instead of refunding.
## Impact
Since this can be classified as user mistake, this might be a low or medium issue. I couldn't decide if its low or medium so I am posting this as medium.
