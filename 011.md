# Unlimited Mintable ERC20 (Please ignore - see comment)

## Summary

The ERC20 token does not have a hardcap on supply, potentially leading the owner of the contract to minting a large amount of tokens resulting in loss of value to holders.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ERC20 token allows the owner of the contract to mint an unlimited amount of tokens. This can lead to the value of the token becoming worthless. In the event that the token is paired or have a USD value relative to current supply/demand within the Footium ecosystem, a large amount of tokens could be minted by the owner and sold at current value. Leading to a loss of value in current holders and investors.

This risk will be reduced if the contract owner is a multi-sig wallet with a requirement of multiple signers.

## Impact

Assuming the ecosystem is driven by this token, the token will be worthless and the project will incur large reputational damage.

        _mint(receiver, amount);  
}`

## Recommendation

Although tokenomics has to be carefully designed and evaluated. Implementing a hard-cap on the token will prevent the contract owner minting unlimited tokens and driving the token price down.
