# `whenNotPaused` is added to `claimERC20Prize` and `claimETHPrize`

## Summary
It is never recommended that rewards/prizes are not accessible/withdraw-able to users when admin decided to pause the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Admin being able to pause reward claiming function indicates that admin could anytime rugpool / freeze the state of the contract and hurts reputation of the system.

```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(
        address _to,
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```

and in

```solidity
function claimETHPrize(
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant
```
