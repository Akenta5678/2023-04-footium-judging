# `setApprovalForERC20` will revert for tokens that need a previous approval of 0 tokens

## Summary

Some popular ERC20 tokens like USDT need the user to approve `0` tokens, before approving the required `amount`. If not, their `approve()` function will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `FootiumEscrow` contract relies on the function `setApprovalForERC20()` to set approvals for the tokens it holds:

```solidity
    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount); // @audit
    }
```

This will revert for the mentioned tokens.

## Impact

The `setApprovalForERC20` function won't be able to approve the requested tokens to another address as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an approval of `0` before the `amount` approval:

```diff
    function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
+       erc20Contract.approve(to, 0);
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
```
