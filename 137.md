# Unchecked ERC20 transfers

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
Typically, successful ERC20 transfer and transferFrom calls return true. In the claimERC20Prize function, _token.transfer(_to, value) is called, where _token refers to the ERC20 asset used in the prize. If the ERC20 asset used does not comply with the EIP-20 standard, a failed transaction may return false instead of reverting. This would still count as a valid transaction, even though it is not. USDT is one of the example that does not comply with EIP-20 standard

## Impact
The user may not be able to receive the prize at all.
