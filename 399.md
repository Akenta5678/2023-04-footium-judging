# Bad implementation in minter access control for FootiumClub contract

## Summary

The FootiumClub contract defines a mint function that is protected by an onlyRole modifier:

## Vulnerability Detail

    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
    {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

        _mint(to, tokenId);

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }


The modifier implementation is flawed as there isn't any check for a require or revert, the comparison will silently return false and let the execution continue:

## Impact

Any account can mint any number of FootiumClub tokens.

This represents a critical issue as receipts can be used to claim rewards in quests. An attacker can freely mint receipt tokens for any quest to steal all the rewards from it.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

The modifier should require that the caller is the minterAddress in order to revert the call in case this condition doesnâ€™t hold.
