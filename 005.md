# FootiumClub.sol can't receive NFTs because of missing onERC721Received callback

## Summary

There is no onERC721Received callback in the FootiumClub.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

When we call mintPlayers() in FootiumAcademy.sol, we call the safeMint() implementation in FootiumPlayer.sol which, in its turn, calls internal _safeMint implementation from ERC721 standard. Since FootiumClub is a smart contract and not an EOA, it should implement onERC721Received().
 
## Impact

High-risk vulnerability because it breaks one of the protocol's key features by disallowing for clubs to receive NFT.

## Code Snippet

Here's the mintPlayers() from FootiumAcademy.sol:

Then FootiumPlayer.sol safeMint():

And the FootiumClub: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add onERC721Received() to FootiumClub to make it able to handle ERC721 tokens.
