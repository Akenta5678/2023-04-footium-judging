# Contract should Approve zero first

## Summary
Some ERC20 token would revert if approval from non-zero allowance.
## Vulnerability Detail
Inorder to support wide range of tokens including USDT which implement anti-race condition on token approvals. 
## Impact
Approval could revert if the token enforces anti-race conditions on Approval.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
``` 
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
can be refactored to:
```diff
function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
+ erc20Contract.approve(to, 0);
  erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
```
