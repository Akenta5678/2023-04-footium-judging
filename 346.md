# No Upper Limit Set for _royaltyFeePercentage

## Summary

Due to the absence of an upper limit for the _royaltyFeePercentage in the FootiumPlayer#setRoyaltyInfo function. This oversight could lead to the onlyOwner setting the royalty fee to 100%, causing users to potentially lose their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The FootiumPlayer#setRoyaltyInfo function receives two arguments: _receiver address and _royaltyFeePercentage.

```solidity
function setRoyaltyInfo(address _receiver, uint96 _royaltyFeePercentage)
    external
    onlyOwner
{
    _setDefaultRoyalty(_receiver, _royaltyFeePercentage);
}
```
The onlyOwner can inadvertently set the royalty fee to 100% due to the absence of an upper bound while setting the royalty fee, which may result in users losing their funds.

## Impact

Users might lose funds.
