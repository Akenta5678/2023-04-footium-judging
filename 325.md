# ERC20 return values not checked

## Summary
ERC20 transfer return values not checked

## Vulnerability Detail
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens (like USDT) don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard, some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

> Q: Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
Any

As the protocols allow all ERC20 tokens. All interactions with it should follow correct EIP20 checks.

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer.

## Code Snippet
1. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L130
```solidity
        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            // @audit return value not checked 
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }
```
2. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L110
```solidity
    function transferERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        // @audit return value not checked 
        erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
    }
```
3. ERC20.approve return value check not checked as well:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend checking the success boolean of all .transfer calls for the unknown token contract or better use  OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens. Also, it is recommended to check the ERC20.approve return value as well.
