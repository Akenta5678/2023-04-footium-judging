# Excess payment is not refunded

## Summary
Academy contract accepts overpayment for `mintPlayers()`

## Vulnerability Detail

Any excess payment made to the `FootiumAcademy.sol` to mint players are accepted by the contract. This is not a good idea as the players may send more funds then they should to the contract. The excess funds won't be send to the `_prizeDistributorAddress` and instead will stay in the `FootiumAcademy.sol` and can be withdrawn by the owner.


## Impact
Owners may choose to take the funds for themselves or manually refund to the users which causes waste of gas.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
   uint256 totalFee = playerCount * divisionToFee[divisionTier];
        if (msg.value < totalFee) {
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
        }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `msg.value < totalFee` on L:259 to `msg.value != totalFee`
