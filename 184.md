# Escrow contract lacks the functionality to approve ERC721 tokens with specified IDs.

## Summary

`Escrow` contract lacks the functionality to approve ERC721 tokens with specified IDs.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Escrow` contract responsible for storing Clubs' inventory has a few functions that enable the current Club owner to move assets from the `Escrow` balance and integrate it with external protocols and routers. 
However, while the `setApprovalForERC20()` and `setApprovalForERC721()` functions allow for the approval of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, respectively, the contract lacks the ability to approve ERC721 tokens with specific IDs. As a result, Club owners are forced to set approvals for all NFTs in the collection that the Escrow contract owns. 
This may lead to the theft of `Escrow` assets in scenarios where a Club owner approves a third-party router for transferring all IDs in the collection, trades an NFT with a specific ID, and an attacker uses the remaining approval to steal other NFTs from the `Escrow` balance.

## Impact

Club owners are required to approve the entire ERC721 collection each time, even when they only need to transfer an NFT with a specific ID. This could lead to stealing assets from the `Escrow` balance. Also, documentation of the inherited ERC721Holder explicitly states that the contract should be able to call `IERC721-approve`.

## Code Snippet

Comments in `ERC721Holder` code which `Escrow` inherits inform that the contract should be able to call the `IERC721-approve` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L15
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC721Receiver} interface.
 *
 * Accepts all token transfers.
 * Make sure the contract is able to use its token with {IERC721-safeTransferFrom}, {IERC721-approve} or {IERC721-setApprovalForAll}.
 */
contract ERC721Holder is IERC721Receiver {
    /**
     * @dev See {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}.
     *
     * Always returns `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector`.
     */
    function onERC721Received(
        address,
        address,
        uint256,
        bytes memory
    ) public virtual override returns (bytes4) {
        return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a function to the `Escrow` contract that allows the club owner to call IERC721-approve on arbitrary ERC721 token.
