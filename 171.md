# Cannot pause transfers on FootiumClub because of wrong inherited class

## Summary
Pausing FootiumClub only pauses mints and not transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since FootiumClub inherits ERC721Upgradeable class, it is not aware of the pausable abilities of the child contract:

When the admin pauses the contract, only methods explicitely using `whenNotPaused` modifier would be impacted, in this case only `safeMint`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L56-L69


This would not pause transferability of the tokens, which would still allow them to be traded on secondary, which may not be desirable when trying to work out an emergency.

## Impact
Pausing the NFT contract still enables transfers, and activity on secondary.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
FootiumClub should inherit ERC721PausableUpgradeable class of openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable, implementing a check on paused in `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook:
