# Previous owner can take club tokens (players, etc.) when selling.

## Summary

The Footium Club NFTs are meant to be tradeable on decentralized marketplaces. The club holds tokens (Player NFTs, Footium Tokens, etc.) in its corresponding escrow contract. A user can sell the club, making a the buyer think he will get the club with all its players etc. Just before the club is transferred the previous owner can transfer out all tokens to another account. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The escrow contract, holding the clubÂ´s assets stands on its own and has the `transferERC20` and `transferERC721` functions, which are only callable by the club owner.
Therefore, when the club token is to be transferred (e.g. because it was sold) , the previous owner can frontrun the transferFrom transaction of the actual club NFT and call the 2 before mentioned methods to transfer the tokens out of the escrow contract.

## Impact

A possible buyer of the Club NFT does not get the club with all its players and assets as expected.
