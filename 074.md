# Certain ERC-20 tokens will become locked within escrow contracts

## Summary
Tokens that do not return a `bool` value when the `transfer` function is called can become locked in escrow contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some very popular ERC-20 tokens such as USDT do not return a `bool` value when the `transfer` function is called. With such tokens, ever since Solidity version 0.4.22 and the introduction of the `RETURNDATASIZE` opcode, these transfers will revert as they do not meet expectations within the EVM.

The `transferERC20` function in `FootiumEscrow` does not account for these tokens.

```solidity
function transferERC20(IERC20 erc20Contract, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyClubOwner {
    erc20Contract.transfer(to, amount);
}
```

## Impact
When attempting to transfer no-return tokens out of the escrow contract, the transaction will revert and the tokens will remain locked within the escrow contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library to transfer ERC-20 tokens. This will ensure that tokens are not locked in escrow contracts.
