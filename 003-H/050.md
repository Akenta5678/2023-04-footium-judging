# Issue with Claiming Lesser Prizes in Club's Prize Distribution System

## Summary
In the current prize distribution system, a club cannot claim a new prize with a lesser amount than previously claimed due to an underflow issue. The `totalETHClaimed[club_address]` does not reset, which prevents the club from receiving smaller prizes in subsequent distributions.
## Vulnerability Detail
If a club possesses a Merkle proof allowing them to claim 10 Ether from the prize distributor, they will be unable to claim another prize with a lesser amount under a new Merkle root. When the club claims the initial 10 Ether using their Merkle proof, the `totalETHClaimed[club_address]` is set to 10 Ether. Later, if the owner updates the Merkle root and allocates a prize of 5 Ether for the same club, the club will be unable to claim the new prize. The reason is that the `totalETHClaimed[club_address]` has not been reset, and attempting to claim 5 Ether results in an underflow. Consequently, the club can only claim prizes greater than 10 Ether, with each subsequent claimable prize being larger than the previous one.
## Impact
Same applies to ERC20 token prize distribution aswell, since this contract should be usable with different merkle roots, I'll label it as high

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put a function to reset the storage for clubs such that the new merkle roots can be updated and same contract can be used.
