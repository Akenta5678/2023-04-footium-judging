# Possible faulty calculation of prize amount in FootiumPrizeDistributor

## Summary
`totalERC20Claimed` and `totalETHClaimed` stores all claimed amount instead of per season which may cause errors while calculating the value to be sent.

## Vulnerability Detail

All the claimed rewards, regardless of the season, are accounted in two mappings, `totalERC20Claimed` and `totalETHClaimed`. These mappings are updated with each claim but they never get resetted.  The amount to be claimed is calculated by subtracting `totalClaimed` from `_amount`. Also it should be noted that there is only a single merkle root and that will be used for all claims.


Assume a user wins and claims USDC 100 in season 1, this amount is stored in totalERC20Claimed for USDC address.
If the same user wins USDC 50 in season 2, call will be reverted on the following line because of underflow:

Because of the same reason, if the same user receives USDC 150 prize in season 2, they will receive only USDC 50.

> It can be argued that this issue may be resolved with off-chain calculation and adding past rewards cumulatively to the merkle tree. This process is error prone and centralized as it requires a lot of manual calculations.

> Note: This is why the issue is labeled as Medium, without cumulative off-chain reward calculation, it would be a High issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add seasonId to the mapping of claimed rewards to enable claiming rewards per season also keep multiple merkle roots for each seasons rewards.

```solidity
mapping (uint256 => bytes32) private erc20MerkleRootPerSeason;
mapping (uint256 => bytes32) private ethMerkleRootPerSeason;
mapping (IERC20Upgradeable => mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)))
        private totalERC20ClaimedPerSeason;
mapping (address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private totalETHClaimedPerSeason;

```
