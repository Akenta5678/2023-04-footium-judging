# User might be unable to claim his rewards due to underflow

## Summary
User might be unable to claim his rewards due to underflow

## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol contract has two functions to claim rewards `claimETHPrize` and `claimERC20Prize`.
In both functions we have the following statement:
```solidity
uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];
```

Consider the situation:
1. For example user earned 4 ETH as rewards. He calls `claimETHPrize` with 4 ETH amount and successfully claims rewards.
`totalETHClaimed[_to]` value increased by 4 ETH
```solidity
totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;
```
2. The second time user earned only 3 ETH and when he calls `claimETHPrize` the following statement reverts due to underflow (`value = 3 - 4;`).
```solidity
uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];
```

Also this problem is present when a user attempts to withdraw a portion of the rewards
## Impact
User might be unable to claim his rewards. This issue become more serious with time because user need more and more tokens or ETH to claim his rewards

## Recommendation
When setting new merkleRoot reset `totalETHClaimed` mapping
