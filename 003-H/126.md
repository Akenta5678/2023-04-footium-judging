# FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol wrong subtraction in claimETHPrize

## Summary

Incomplete check/validation could cause execution of `claimETHPrize()` fail due to the integer underflow whenever the ETH `_amount` user `_to` would like to claim is less than `totalETHClaimed[_to]`

## Vulnerability Detail

Look at the lines from[FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L163-L166:]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/11736f3f7f7efa88cb99ee98b04b85a46621347c/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L163-L166)

```solidity
        uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];

        if (value > 0) {
            totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;
```

## Impact

All `claimETHPrize()` execution could fail due to the integer underflow whenever the ETH `_amount` user `-to`would like to claim is less than `totalETHClaimed[_to]`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A check should introduced and the lines should instead be changed to:

```solidity
 _amount > totalETHClaimed[_to] ?
        uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to]: 0

        if (value > 0) {
            totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;
```

Also these lines need more comment as i couldn't really get my head around what they do
