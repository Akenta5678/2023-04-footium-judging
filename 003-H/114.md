# The user may not receive the full reward amount

## Summary
If a team receives rewards in different leagues and calls the `claimERC20Prize()` function for the second time to retrieve the rewards, they cannot receive the corresponding amount of rewards because totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] stores the value from the previous claim.

## Vulnerability Detail
The total prize pools per league are split between the teams finishing in positions 1â€“9 in the league each season. The `FootiumPrizeDistributor()` is used to allow an address to claim an ERC20 token reward. Inside the function, it  updates the total claimed reward for the `_to` address and transfers the unredeemed reward amount to the `_to` address.
If a team receives rewards in different leagues and calls the `claimERC20Prize()` function for the second time to retrieve the rewards, they cannot receive the corresponding amount of rewards because totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] stores the value from the previous claim.
The same issue for `claimETHPrize()` function.
```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(
        address _to,
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        if (_to != msg.sender) {
            revert InvalidAccount();
        }

        if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                erc20MerkleRoot,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_token, _to, _amount))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidERC20MerkleProof();
        }

        uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];

        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }

        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
    }

```

## Impact
The user cannot receive the full reward amount during their second attempt to claim, due to the fact that totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] stores the value from the previous claim
