# user can be blocked from receiving a prize with same prize token.

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
A user can be blocked from receiving a prizewith the same prize token. For example, let's say a user receives a prize of 100 USDT in the first round. If the same user receives another 100 USDT prize in the second round with the same token, the user cannot receive an additional 100 USDT prize because the totalERC20Claimed[token][_to] value for that token is already stored as 100.

Here is the scenario:

1. Alice wins the first season and receives a prize of 100 USDT.
2. The owner calculates Alice's prize off-chain and creates a Merkle Root to make the ERC20MerkleRoot using setERC20MerkleRoot.
3. Alice claims the prize (100 USDT) by using the claimERC20Prize() function. At this time, the totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] value is stored as 100 USDT.
4. Alice wins the second season and receives 100 USDT again.
5. The owner creates a Merkle Root off-chain, just like before, and stores the ERC20MerkleRoot.
6. Alice attempts to claim the prize using the claimERC20Prize() function, but she cannot receive the prize because the totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] value is already set to 100 from the first season.

## Impact
User will not be able to receive a prize.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this situation, it is recommended to set a round ID and store the Merkle Root for each round. Additionally, it is recommended to modify totalERC20Claimed as shown in the following code:

```solidity
// totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to][roundID]
mapping(IERC20Upgradeable => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))) private totalERC20Claimed;

// erc20MerkleRoot[roundId] = merkleroot
mapping private mapping(uint256 => bytes32) erc20MerkleRoot;
mapping private mapping(uint256 => bytes32) ethMerkleRoot;
```
