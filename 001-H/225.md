# Can approve away their own club, getting tokens and the club stolen

## Summary

Granting approvals for `FootiumClub` allows to temporarily become the owner of the club which allows stealing `FootiumPlayer`s


## Vulnerability Detail

The `FootiumEscrow` allows to grant approvals of tokens held inside of `FootiumEscrow`

If `FootiumClub` is ever borrowed, even temporarily, for example via a flashloan, then the temporary owner will be able to bypass the check for ownership and they'll be able to grant approvals from the `FootiumEscrow` for all `FootiumPlayer`s


## Impact

Loss of players

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L95-L96

```solidity
        erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(to, approved);

```

Even by just having the ability to transfer, even if temporarily, the escrow will read a new owner, allowing to sweep away the players

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It may be best for Owners to self-custody the `FootiumPlayers` as a way to avoid them getting their NFTs stolen via gotchas
