# Previous club owner can steal future bought or minted NFTs (players) from new owner

## Summary

The Footium Club NFTs are meant to be tradeable on decentralized marketplaces. The club holds ERC721 Tokesn (Player NFTs) in its corresponding escrow contract. A user can sell the club, but making sure, that he approves himself for all ERC721 Tokens on the escrow contract before.

## Vulnerability Detail

The escrow contract, holding the club´s assets stands on its own and has the `approveERC721` function which allows to call the current owner `setApproveForAll` on any ERC721 contract on the behalf of the escrow contract.

A malicious user can: 
1. Buy a club on the marketplace.
2. call `approveERC721` for the FootiumPlayer Contract
3. sell the club again on the marketplace.
4. when the new owner buys or mints new player NFT´s he can transfer them, because there is an infinte approval.


## Impact

the previous owner of the club can possibly steal all assets (especially player NFTs) of the club, even it is now owned by the buyer.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L90-L96

```solidity
function setApprovalForERC721(
        IERC721 erc721Contract,
        address to,
        bool approved
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(to, approved);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `transferFrom` function of the FootiumClub contract should be overwritten & reset all the approvals made on the escrow for the old owner.
