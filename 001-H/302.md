# Bad owner can give approval to himself to spend future ERC20 tokens

## Summary
An owner can give himself approval to spend the ERC20 tokens of an escrow account and can spend them even after he sells the corresponding club NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail

When buying a club NFT and the corresponding escrow contract a user normally does not check if any approvals for spending ERC20 tokens are set. This means, that the current owner of a club NFT can use `setApprovalForERC20` and approve himself to spend a big amount of ERC20 tokens. Once he sells the club NFT and therefore should not have any access to the escrow account he can still withdraw all ERC20 tokens that end up in the escrow account.   

## Impact

The new owner of the club NFT can lose all of the ERC20 tokens that get deposited to the clubâ€™s escrow account

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be a tool in the front end that warns new owners if the escrow account if a club has approved anyone to spend any ERC20 tokens and there is still allowance left to spend. An array of addresses that got approved could be used for tracking and a public function could be used to check how much allowance each approved account still has.
