# Previous owner of a club can extract assets of a Footium escrow, through unrevoked approvals

## Summary
Upon transfer of club, old owner can extract all assets because of unrevoked approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail
Footium escrow is a contract acting like a vault for a club assets (players nfts, erc20 rewards). To interact with marketplaces and other protocols, the owner of a club can approve addresses to transfer these assets:

Alice can set approvals for assets held by the Footium escrow to herself and list the club NFT on a marketplace such as Opensea or Rarible.  
Bob, the innocent buyer checks for the players held by the club before deciding to buy it and is mislead into buying at a higher price.
When the deal goes through, Alice uses the set approvals to transfer all assets held by the escrow to herself, effectively rugging Bob.

## Impact
Buyers of club NFTs on secondary markets can be rugged/cheated, and the exchange rate/liquidity of these NFTs suffer

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Multiple mitigations are envisionable:
- Create an allow list of approval addresses
- Inforce the obligation of an owner to remove all approvals (boolean hasApprovals)
- Create a version number for approvals, and increment it when club is transferred
