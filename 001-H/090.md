# A previous club owner can abuse approvals to steal assets from the club's escrow

## Summary

As approvals are not cleared when `FootiumClub` NFTs are transferred, a previous owner can possibly steal assets from the club's escrow after selling the club NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the protocol, each club is represented by a `FootiumClub` NFT, which is a regular ERC721 token. 

In `FootiumEscrow.sol`, the owner of the club NFT has ownership of all assets held in the club's escrow, as seen by the `onlyClubOwner()` modifier:

```solidity
modifier onlyClubOwner() {
    if (msg.sender != IERC721(footiumClubAddress).ownerOf(clubId)) {
        revert NotClubOwner(clubId, msg.sender);
    }
    _;
}
```

From conversing with the sponsor, it is confirmed that club NFTs are meant to be traded:

The club's owner can approve ERC20 and ERC721 token transfers from the `FootiumEscrow` contract using [`setApprovalForERC20()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L75C14-L81) and [`setApprovalForERC721()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L90C14-L96) respectively. 

Therefore, if the club NFT is ever sold, the club's owner can steal assets from the NFT buyer by doing the following:
1. Approve the transfer of all assets in the club's escrow to himself using `setApprovalForERC20()` and `setApprovalForERC721()`.
2. Sell the club - transfer the club NFT to the buyer.
3. Transfer all assets out of the escrow using the approvals.

## Impact

A previous owner can steal all assets in the escrow from the current club owner.

## Recommendation

Consider revoking all existing approvals from the club's escrow whenever a club NFT is transferred. 

Alternatively, create a new escrow for the club NFT whenever it is transferred, and transfer all assets from the old escrow to the new one.
