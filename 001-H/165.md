# When a club sold to a third party, previous approvals from Escrow contract are not revoked

## Summary
Club owners can approve any token amounts for any addresses in the Escrow contract. However, due to the non-iterative nature of mappings in the EVM, it is challenging to track these approvals. When a club is sold, the new owner must revoke all existing token approvals within the Escrow contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
As a club owner, one can grant approvals for any token amounts and addresses within the Escrow contract. However, since mappings in the EVM are non-iterative objects, tracking these approvals becomes very difficult. When a club changes ownership, the new owner of the Escrow contract must revoke all previously granted token approvals to ensure proper control over the contract.
## Impact
As stated above, the new owner can revoke all the approvals one-by-one calling the Escrow approve function. However, due to how mappings are stored in the contracts storage it is quite hard a task to do for new owner. Also, new owner must pay the gas cast for each revoke approval which can be costly if there are lots of approvals given from previous owner.

## Recommendation
Keep track of the allowances inside the contract as an array such that the previous allowances can easily detected and revoked by new owner.
