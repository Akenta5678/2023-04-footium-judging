# Malicious Club Owner could approve himself on the Escrow prior to a marketplace transaction, allowing them to withdraw future owner's tokens

## Summary

A malicious club owner can approve himself or a contract on `FootiumEscrow` for any ERC-721 or ERC-20 asset, then proceed to sell the Club on a secondary market. An unknowing user who purchases this club would now be the owner of both the club and the tampered-with escrow. Later on, as per the protocol's behaviour, this user could mint new `FootiumPlayer` players from the `FootiumAcademy` which would be minted for the user's club's escrow contract. The previous owner, who was approved as operator for the escrow, can transfer out these tokens as soon as they are minted.

## Vulnerability Detail

On `FootiumClub` minting, a `FootiumEscrow` is created and bound to this specific club, and only this club's **owner** can call the Escrow's functions. A malicious owner could call [`setApprovalForERC721`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#L90C14-L94) and approve himself (or any other arbitrary address) for any token contract with `setApprovalForAll(address, uint256)` signature - in this example, a `FootiumPlayer` which is an ERC-721. 

> This process is also analogous when calling [`setApprovalForERC20`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#LL75C1-L79C2) for ERC-20 tokens.

The modifier [ `onlyClubOwner`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#LL33C3-L38C6) checks the club's ownership by making the external call [`IERC721.ownerOf()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#LL34C27-L34C71) , which means the only requirement for this check to pass is that the caller is the **current** club's holder. 

When [minting a new `FootiumPlayer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#LL166C5-L172C7) from the `FootiumAcademy`, this fresh new Player [will be minted to the user's club's Escrow contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#LL196C13-L198C15). 

The malicious actor that owns a Club, who has approved himself on the Escrow, can proceed to a secondary market and perform a sale of his Club token. This token now belongs to a new user, which means they are now the Escrow's owner. When this user is elegible to mint a new Player from the Academy, this freshly minted token will be held by the user's club's Escrow. The previous owner is approved as operator of this contract, so they can transfer out the Player as soon as it is minted. 

## Impact
A common user would not expect this behaviour nor is it trivial to expect them to check for approvals on the Escrow contract prior to purchasing a Club on a secondary marketplace. The moment a user fulfils a purchase and becomes the new Club owner, they will receive assets on their club's Escrow (i.e. ERC-721s like freshly minted Players from the Academy, or any other arbitrary ERC-20 / ERC-721 tokens). The previous owner could have approved themselves (or a contract) prior to the purchase and can transfer these assets out.

## Code Snippet

`FootiumEscrow`'s [`setApprovalForERC721`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumEscrow.sol#LL90C4-L96C6) is the main function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Given that secondary marketplace operations are not handled by Footium contracts, there is no way to know when the Club is sold from within the Escrow. Closest we can do is to assume this is happening every time a Club is transferred. 

My proposal would be to:
- Store approved addresses in a Set on `FootiumEscrow` each time `setApprovalForERC721` is called. 
- Introduce a view function on `FootiumEscrow` to check whether there are pending approvals that have not been revoked (i.e. check whether the Set is empty or not), and
- Add an external function to clear all approvals by setting the allowance to 0. (Only callable by the club owner, or perhaps even the club contract itself).

Then, on `FootiumClub`, override either `transfer()` or hooks like `_beforeTokenTransfer()` and add a call to the corresponding club's `FootiumEscrow` to check that there are no pending-to-revoke approvals, otherwise revert.

The idea behind this would be to prevent Club transfers unless there are no approvals on the Escrow.
The reason as to separating the revoking logic from the transfer execution is to:
- Avoid additional gas usage on transfers
- Avoid potential OOG if there are too many approved addresses pending (The function on `FootiumEscrow` could be made to partially revoke addresses, as a way to account for available gas)

> Solution is not elegant and due to time constraints I am not able to provide a concrete implementation, but I propose this as an idea to try to avoid this vulnerability on both ERC-721s and ERC-20s. 
> Otherwise, `FootiumPlayer` could be tweaked specifically to expire allowances after certain conditions have passed, but doing this would only "fix" the issue for Player tokens, but all other tokens would still be vulnerable.
