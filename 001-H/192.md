# `FootiumEscrow.sol#setApprovalForXXX` could be used to scam NFT traders

## Summary

`FootiumEscrow.sol#setApprovalForXXX` could be used to defraud NFT traders

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: FootiumEscrow.sol
 75     function setApprovalForERC20(
 76         IERC20 erc20Contract,
 77         address to,
 78         uint256 amount
 79     ) external onlyClubOwner {
 80         erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
 81     }
--skip--
 90     function setApprovalForERC721(
 91         IERC721 erc721Contract,
 92         address to,
 93         bool approved
 94     ) external onlyClubOwner {
 95         erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(to, approved);
 96     }
```

Each clubNFT has an Escrow contract to store assets, and the owner of the club can control the assets in it. The `setApprovalForERC20` and `setApprovalForERC721` functions are used to authorize an address. The problem now is that when the club is traded or consigned, the original owner may use these two interfaces to steal the funds of the club.

The attack path is as follows:

1. Alias owns ClubA, and approves the ClubA's Escrow to herself
2. Alias consigns ClubA to the exchange
3. Bob thinks the price of ClubA is reasonable and buys ClubA. Bob thinks this transaction is very safe, because the owner of ClubA is already an exchange, and Bob trusts the exchange very much
4. Alias stole ClubA's assets after the transaction, because she has been approved

## Impact
