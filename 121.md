# Single-step process for critical ownership transfer/renounce is risky

## Summary

If an incorrect address, e.g. for which the private key is not known, is used accidentally then it prevents the use of all the `onlyOwner()` functions forever

## Vulnerability Detail

The Footium protocol allows owners to set/approve/transfer and make other important execution which implies that the contract ownership plays a critical role in the protocol.

Given that most contracts i scope inherit from OwnableUpgradeable, the ownership management of this contract defaults to OZâ€™s transferOwnership() and renounceOwnership() methods which are not overridden here. Such critical address transfer/renouncing in one-step is very risky because it is irrecoverable from any mistakes.

Scenario: If an incorrect address, e.g. for which the private key is not known, is used accidentally then it prevents the use of all the `onlyOwner()` functions forever, which includes the changing of various critical addresses and parameters. This use of incorrect address may not even be immediately apparent given that these functions are probably not used immediately. When noticed, due to a failing `onlyOwner()` function call, it will force the redeployment of these contracts and require appropriate changes and notifications for switching from the old to new address. This will diminish trust in the protocol and incur a significant reputational damage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Override the inherited methods to null functions and use separate functions for a two-step address change: 1) Approve a new address as a pendingOwner 2) A transaction from the pendingOwner address claims the pending ownership change. This mitigates risk because if an incorrect address is used in step (1) then it can be fixed by re-approving the correct address. Only after a correct address is used in step (1) can step (2) happen and complete the address/ownership change.

Also, consider adding a time-delay for such sensitive actions. And at a minimum, use a multisig owner address and not an EOA.
