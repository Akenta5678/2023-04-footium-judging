# Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Summary
In FootiumClub.sol contract, function safeMint uses the internal OZ _mint function. Should use _safeMint instead.
## Vulnerability Detail
A new football club NFT will be minted to the `to` address in the safeMint function: 
```solidity
  function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
    {
        FootiumEscrow escrow = new FootiumEscrow(address(this), tokenId);
        clubToEscrow[tokenId] = escrow;

        _mint(to, tokenId);

        emit EscrowDeployed(tokenId, escrow);
    }
``` 
However, if `to`  is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

> A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

As per the documentation of ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin

Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/a7ee03565b4ee14265f4406f9e38a04e0143656f/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L253

```solidity
/* WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible
*
* Requirements:
*
* - `tokenId` must not exist.
* - `to` cannot be the zero address.
*
* Emits a {Transfer} event.

    function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {
``` 
## Impact
Could lead to the loss of NFTs.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `_safeMint` instead of `_mint` to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
