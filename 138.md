# Unclaimed token and ETH will be locked

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
If a user does not claim their prize before the next round's Merkle root is set, the tokens or ETH will be locked in the contract. Teams can claim unclaimed prizes in an improper way, but it would be more appropriate to create a withdrawUnclaimedPrizes() function that allows the team to claim remaining rewards from the previous round before creating the next round merkle root.

## Impact
unclaimed prize will be locked in contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
make a function to claim unclaimed prize, and here is an example:

```solidity
function **withdrawUnclaimedPrizes(IERC20Upgradeable _token) external onlyOwner() {
		uint256 value = _token.balanceOf(address(this));
		_token.safeTransfer(owner(), value);
}**
```
