# USDT will get permanently stuck in `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` and `FootiumEscrow.sol`

## Summary
As stated in the docs, the contracts are stated to work with any ERC20 tokens. If USDT or any USDT-like tokens are sent to `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` and `FootiumEscrow.sol`, they will be forever stuck. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumEscrow.sol` and `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` use such `IERC20/IERC20Upgradeable` interfaces, that expect a boolean to be returned from the `transfer` method. USDT, for example, doesn't return such value. When calling `FootiumEscrow.sol#setApprovalForERC20` `FootiumEscrow.sol#transferERC20` and `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#claimERC20Prize` the address of the token is expected to comply with the `IERC20` interface. Since `USDT` doesn't comply with the interface the transactions will revert. Any USDT-like sent to any of the two contracts mentioned will get permanently lost. 
Note:
Since USDT does not return a boolean when .transferFrom is called, but the ERC20 interface used defines that there will be a boolean returned, the compiler will check whether the returndatasize() is 32 bytes (one word size) and revert if this is not true.

## Impact
Permanent loss of any USDT/ USDT-like tokens sent to `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` and `FootiumEscrow.sol`

## Recommendation
Do not use IERC20 interface. Also, use SafeERC20 library
