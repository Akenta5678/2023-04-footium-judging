# Have to be approved to zero first

## Summary
Have to be approved to zero first

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens like USDT require resetting the approval to 0 first before being able to reset it to another value.
The erc20Contract.approve function does not do this.

## Impact
Unsafe ERC20 approve that do not handle non-standard erc20 behavior.
1.Some token contracts do not return any value.
2.Some token contracts revert the transaction when the allowance is not zero.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function setApprovalForERC20(
        IERC20 erc20Contract,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyClubOwner {
        erc20Contract.approve(to, amount);
    }
```
