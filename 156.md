# The `balance` of `FootiumAcademy` contract would be used by the attacker which calling `mintPlayers` function

## Summary
If there has any native token in the `FootiumAcademy` contract, attacker can use it to mint players. This makes the `withdraw` function not the only one capable of transferring native tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166-L212
This code segment has not check the value of `msg.value`. It may use the balance of `FootiumAcademy` contract to excute `_prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("")` function.
```solidity
(bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
if (!sent) {
    revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
}
```

## Impact
Normally, the balance of `FootiumAcademy` contract is transfer by `withdraw` function. However, it would used by attacker through the `mintPlayers` function.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L166-L212
```solidity
function mintPlayers(
    SeasonID seasonId,
    uint256 clubId,
    uint256 divisionTier,
    uint256[] calldata generationIds,
    bytes32[] calldata divisionProof
) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    uint256 totalFee = _validateMintingParams(
        seasonId,
        clubId,
        divisionTier,
        generationIds,
        divisionProof
    );

    uint256 generationId;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < generationIds.length; ) {
        generationId = generationIds[i];

        if (generationId > _maxGenerationId) {
            revert GenerationIDTooHigh(generationId, _maxGenerationId);
        }

        if (redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId]) {
            revert PlayerAlreadyRedeemed(generationId);
        }

        redeemed[seasonId][clubId][generationId] = true;

        uint256 playerId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
            _footiumClub.clubToEscrow(clubId)
        );

        emit AcademyPlayerMinted(seasonId, clubId, generationId, playerId);

        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }

    // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
    (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
    if (!sent) {
        revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Suggest to ensure the value of `msg.value` is not less than `totalFee`.
```solidity
require(msg.value >= totalFee);
(bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: totalFee}("");
if (!sent) {
    revert FailedToSendETH(totalFee);
}
```
