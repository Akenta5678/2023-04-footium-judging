# Single-step process for critical ownership transfer is risky

## Summary
`FootiumAcademy` , `FootiumClub` , `FootiumClubMinter` , `FootiumGeneralPaymentContract` , `FootiumPlayer`, `FootiumPrizeDistributor` & `FootiumToken` contracts uses the OZ Ownable implementation that handles the transfer of ownership in a single-step. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Transferring the ownership of a contract in a single step is prompt to errors, which if it ever occurs, such an operation is irreversible causing the protocol to lose ownership over the contracts, which could end up requiring redeploying all the contracts and notifying all the users and stakeholders.

## Impact
If an incorrect address, e.g. for which the private key is not known, is used accidentally then it prevents the use of all the onlyOwner() functions forever.
This use of incorrect address may not even be immediately apparent given that these functions are probably not used immediately. When noticed, due to a failing onlyOwner() function call, it will force the redeployment of the factory contract and require appropriate changes and notifications for switching from the old to new address. This will diminish trust in markets and incur a significant reputational damage.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Opt to implement the **two-step Ownable Implementation.**
Instead of using the [OwanbleUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol) contract, use the [Ownable2StepUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2StepUpgradeable.sol) contract, where the role recipient is set and then the recipient has to claim that role to finalize the role transfer.
Make sure to update the calls to initialize the Ownable variables from `__Ownable_init()` to `__Ownable2Step_init()`.
