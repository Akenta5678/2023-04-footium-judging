# safeMint() function in FootiumClub.sol doesn't check if there is onERC721Received callback in recipient contract

## Summary

The contract's wrong implementation of safeMint() function can lead to a loss of NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail

In FootiumClub.sol, there is safeMint() function that uses internal _mint and mints a football club. So if it's EOA account, it's fine, but if the recipient of the club is the smart contract, NFT can be easily lost due to absence of _checkOnERC721Received that is present is safeMint() funtion.

## Impact

High-risk vulnerability. Possible loss of NFT and inability to receive the football club.

## Recommendation

Use safeMint() as footiumPlayer.sol (correct implementation) or check if the recipient can be only EOA account.
