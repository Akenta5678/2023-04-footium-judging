# ERC20 token approval cannot be renewed for some tokens

## Summary
ERC20 token approval cannot be renewed for tokens that requires a 0 approve value prior.

## Vulnerability Detail
Tokens such as USDT do not work when changing allowance. Approve will revert if current approve is not 0. This means that approve cannot be changed once a previous approval has been set.

## Impact
Token approval cannot be renewed or changed once the first approval is made.

## Recommendation
Consider adding approve(0) before approving the actual amount.
