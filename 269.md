# `setDivisionFees()` could be frontrun to pay less player minting fee

## Summary

When the owner set new fee for some division, the tx could be frontrun by the club owner to mint players, reduce the fee to pay. 


## Vulnerability Detail

Assuming the fee for division C is 3%, the owner is trying to call `setDivisionFees()` to increase the fee to 5%. The club owner of division C could frontrun this tx to mint all the players available. As a result, the fee was expected to be 5%, but only 3% could be received.


## Impact

The prize pool could receive less fee for minting players than ought to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When calculate the minting fee, set some effective period, so that the setter function will not take effects immediately, and the users won't take advantage of the fee change.
