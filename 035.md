# Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Summary
Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_to` will be minted as a proof of footium football club when `safeMint()` is called.

However, if `_to` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.
