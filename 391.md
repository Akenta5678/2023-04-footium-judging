# Unsafe usage of ERC20 transfer

## Summary

Some ERC20 transfers could fail without reverting, engendering loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens don't revert when transfer fails, they may return a boolean or do nothing (see `USDT` or `ZRX` tokens).
And ERC20 unsafe transfer function is used 2 times in the footium codebase.

In `FootiumEscrow.sol`:

And in `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L130


## Impact

In `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol`, if the transfer fails, without reverting, the contract state will assume that prize has been claimed, hence a loss of funds for the prize claimer.

In `FootiumEscrow.sol`, if the transfer fails witjout reverting, the user might think he has transfered the tokens whereas he has not which could engender some troubles.

Note: In these two cases, if the token used is the `FootiumToken` there is no risk, but `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` and `FootiumEscrow.sol` can manage any ERC20 token and it is not written in the documentation that `FootiumToken` will be the only token that might be used by these contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's [SafeERC20 library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20) so that failed transfers would revert.
