# Certain ERC-20 tokens will become locked in the prize distributor contract

## Summary
Tokens that do not return a `bool` value when the `transfer` function is called can become locked in escrow contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some very popular ERC-20 tokens such as USDT do not return a `bool` value when the `transfer` function is called. With such tokens, ever since Solidity version 0.4.22 and the introduction of the `RETURNDATASIZE` opcode, these transfers will revert as they do not meet expectations within the EVM.

The `claimERC20Prize` function in `FootiumPrizeDistributor` does not account for these tokens.

```solidity
if (value > 0) {
    totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
    _token.transfer(_to, value);
}
```

## Impact
If no-return tokens are used as prizes, they will become locked in the prize distributor contract, unable to be claimed.

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library to transfer ERC-20 tokens. This will ensure that tokens are not locked in escrow contracts.
